<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Few men who have ever been in the service of the
United States have enjoyed a more enviable reputation
than Stephen Watts Kearny, or have left behind them
more admiring friends. The recent death of this excellent
soldier, and above all his distinguished services,
covering a space of more than forty years, make his
career at this time peculiarly an object of interest to
the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stephen Watts Kearny was born in the year 1793,
in the town of Newark, New Jersey, in a mansion yet
the property of his family. Though not prone to admit
that the adventitious circumstances of birth add any
real dignity to individuals, either in America or elsewhere,
it may not be improper to state that the family
connections of the deceased general were of such a
character as to have entitled him to a prominent social
position any where, he being a relation of the well-known
Lady Mary Watts, and a connection of the
gallant and noble General Alexander (Lord Stirling)
of the revolutionary army. The grandson of an emigrant,
who settled in New Jersey, before the revolution,
the family of Gen. Kearny had always occupied
a prominent position in society, and exerted much influence
in his native state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the commencement of the war of 1811, young
Kearny, then about eighteen, was a student at Princeton
College. Contrary, it is said, to the advice of his
friends, he obtained a commission from Mr. Madison,
and reported for duty as a lieutenant in the 13th regiment
of infantry, in which he was attached to the
company of which the present very distinguished
General John E. Wool was the captain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With two companies of his regiment he was present
at the gallant affair of Queenstown, and with
Colonel, since Gen. Scott, was surrendered a prisoner
of war. This was on the 13th of October, 1812. In
this affair the companies of the thirteenth had been
long opposed to the greatly celebrated and highly disciplined
forty-ninth British infantry, a regiment which
had stood the ordeal of the Peninsula War, and had
won laurels from the best troops of France. The
forty-ninth had occupied, with heavy reinforcements
of Canadian militia, a battery on a commanding position.
The cannonade and musketry from this point
was so severe that every commissioned officer was in
the first assault either killed or wounded, and Col. Van
<a id='renss'></a>Rensselaer who commanded, was carried from the
field unable to stand. Before he left, however, he
ordered every man who could move to storm the
battery. Three more gallant officers than those who
carried his order into execution probably never lived.
They were Captain Wool, Lieutenant Kearny, and
2nd Lieutenant T. B. Randolph, late of the Virginia
regiment. By orders of Capt. Wool the two companies
of the 13th, which originally had numbered but
one hundred, all told, were extended and ordered to
close upon the guns. This perilous manœuvre was
executed with brilliant success, the enemy were driven
precipitately from his guns, which were the first
trophies to the United States of the war with Great
Britain. This field was young Kearny’s first arms,
and was a brilliant promise of what was to be his
future career. The battle was important to the United
States, though, as is well known, Col. Scott and his
gallant command of regulars were forced to surrender.
To the English it was most disastrous, Major Gen.
Sir Isaac Brock, the captor of Detroit, a man thought
worthy to compete with Wellington for the command
of the British army in Spain, having been picked off
by an American marksman. Throughout this trying
engagement young Kearny sustained himself with the
firmness which he maintained through life. When
driven to the hill selected by the present Col. Totten
as the strongest point, his perseverance was as distinguished
as his impetuosity had been during the charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the surrender, Kearny, with the other prisoners,
was marched to the Canadian village of Niagara,
where, it is said, they were scarcely treated with the
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>
consideration due such gallant soldiers. There occurred
a circumstance of thrilling character often told—the
attempted murder of Col. Scott by the Indian
chiefs “young Brandt and Captain Jacobs,” which, had
it proved successful, would have made irreconcilable
the war between Great Britain and the United States.
It failed through the great personal courage of Col.
Scott and the gallantry of Captain Coffin, an <a id='aide'></a>aide of
Gen. Sheafe, but the would-be murderers were never
punished by the British government. The recurrence
of such scenes, and the probability of long confinement,
exercised a most unhappy effect on the mind of
Kearny, who saw as the consequence of his captivity
(at that day there were no exchanges of prisoners) the
ruin of his professional prospects. After a confinement
of some weeks at Niagara, Kearny was with the other
prisoners sent to Quebec. For a long time he continued
moody and morose, until a circumstance occurred,
which the present general-in-chief relates, that restored
his wonted alertness. The prisoners were taken to
Quebec in a vessel, and from the carelessness incident
to this mode of travel, the idea of a possible
escape <a id='occur'></a>occurred to Col. Scott. The plan was to overpower
the guard, to march at once to the nearest
division of the United States troops on the frontier, and
take their conductors with them as captives. Col.
Scott imparted this plan to Kearny, who at once
entered into it with his whole soul. His energy returned,
and he became again the wild subaltern who
had led the first platoon of the thirteenth at Queenstown.
Circumstances prevented this plot from being
carried into execution, but it had gone far enough to
show that the subject of this memoir had as much prudence
as valor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prisoners at last arrived at Quebec, and their
situation at once became most painful. They were
confined in the old French castle, and were subjected
to many indignities. This was before Niagara and
Lundy’s Lane, and countless other fields had taught
the British army that the American soldiers were
worthy antagonists. At that time the British army
was filled with the aristocracy of the country, which
could not conceive or imagine the true position of
a country without a nobility. Countless trivial insults
were daily given, and which galled to the last degree
the forbearance of the prisoners. The following anecdote
may explain what they were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On one occasion, when the American prisoners dined
at the garrison mess, an officer of the British staff arose,
and with a pointed pomposity gave the toast, “Mr.
Madison, dead or alive.” The faces of the American
officers flushed with indignation, which was not diminished
when they saw a young American lieutenant
rise from his chair, and in the blandest manner, and
with a most insinuating smile, give thanks for the
remembrance of the Chief Magistrate of the United
States. All thought him drunk or mad, as he proceeded
to say, “he felt the weightiness of the burden
imposed on him by the silence of his seniors, that he
would not give thanks for the toast last drunken, but
would give another in return. He was sure the officers
of both services present would understand him when
he gave ‘the health of his royal highness, the Prince
of Wales, <span style='font-size:smaller'>DRUNK OR SOBER</span>.’” If a shell had exploded
under the table the surprise could not have been greater,
and the danger of a collision became imminent, when
the senior officer of the British army present, a man of
tact and taste, interfered, and sent the person who had
given the first toast from the table under arrest. This
anecdote is variously told in the service, and sometimes
is attributed to Gen. Kearny, and sometimes to
the late Mann Page Lomax, major of artillery, who
was at the time a prisoner in the castle of Quebec.
It is perfectly characteristic of each of these officers,
and whether Gen. Kearny be the hero or not, aptly
enough illustrates this portion of his career. The
American victories in the West, by which hosts of
prisoners were acquired, soon placed the men of
Queenstown in a different position, and they were
exchanged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kearny was with Scott at the time the latter officer
resisted the attempt to place in confinement the Irishmen
surrendered at Queenstown, and ably sustained
him in his energetic action in relation to this high-handed
measure. He sailed in the cartel to Boston,
and immediately on his arrival, proceeded to rejoin his
regiment. He was subsequently stationed at Sacket’s
Harbor, where he acquired the reputation for discipline
and soldiership which never deserted him.
While at this post the British commander, Sir James
Yoe, and Commodore Chauncy, were manœuvring for
possession of the lake. On one occasion, when in
possession of a temporary superiority, Sir James appeared
in front of the harbor and challenged the commodore
to a fight. This the latter refused, because
he had no marines. When the reason was told Capt.
Kearny, (he had in the interim been promoted) <a id='noand'></a>a
gallant officer of New York, a captain of artillery,
named Romain, offered at once to go on board and
serve as <a id='marine'></a>marine. The offer was not, however, accepted,
much to the chagrin of Kearny and Romain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Kearny served through the war, and on the
reductions of 1815 and 1821, was retained in the service
with his old grade and rank. In 1823 he received
the usual brevet for ten years faithful service, and was
assigned to the command of the beautiful post of Bellefontaine,
near St. Louis, and in that year accompanied
Brigadier General Atkinson in his famous expedition
to the Upper Missouri. This was before the introduction
of steamboats into those waters, and the expedition
was one of the most tedious imaginable. The
boats were necessarily to be propelled by poles and
oars against the rapid current of the Missouri, and not
unfrequently by the tedious process of <span class='it'>cordelling</span>. This
is done by extending from the capstan of the boat a
cable, which is made fast to the shore, and thus the
vessel must carefully be wound up until the rope is
exhausted. Then a new rope is stretched, and the
same tedious process undergone. Often, when in the
midst of <span class='it'>rapids</span>, the cable would break, and before
the vessel could be brought up, a greater distance than
had been gained in a week would be passed over. In
the course of two years they reached the Yellow
Stone river, twenty-two hundred miles above St. Louis,
and displayed the colors of the 1st and 6th infantry
where the United States flag had never been seen before.
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>
The Sioux, the Pawnee, the Mandan, and
Arickra, were made acquainted with the government,
of which before they had but a vague knowledge, and
the vast resources of that immense country for the first
time revealed to the nation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his return Major Kearny received a full majority
in the third infantry, and was removed to a new
sphere, to the southern extremity of the Indian territory.
While major of this regiment he established the
post of Towson, on the banks of Red River. To reach
this place, easy of access as it is at present, it was necessary
to pass through what was then a wilderness of
prairie, but which to the soldiers inured to the incessant
storms of the Upper Missouri, seemed almost an
Arcadia. After crossing the northern tributaries of
the Arkansas, they were in the midst of the range of
the buffalo, and the countless herds of wild horses
which then abounded even there. The latter, not unfrequently,
amazed at the novel sight of the marching
troops, would dash up, as if to charge the columns,
pause with as much unanimity as if they acted
by command, encircle it, and tossing their long manes
and forelocks, hurry out of view. New objects continually
met his gaze, and the information then amassed
was among the most valuable ever collected under the
auspices of the government. On this march Major
Kearny was accompanied by his accomplished wife,
a step-daughter of Gen. M. Clark, of St. Louis, whom,
about the time of his promotion, he had married. With the
third infantry Major Kearny remained until the Black
Hawk war, when almost all the troops of the country
were concentrated in the country of the hostile Indians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While a major of the third, an incident occurred,
which, though often told, will bear repetition. On
one occasion, while stationed at Jefferson Barracks,
Major Kearny was drilling a brigade on one of the
open fields near the post. The manœuvre was the
simple exercise of marching in line to the front. An
admirable horseman, he sat with his face toward the
troops, while the horse he rode, perfectly trained, was
backed in the same direction, along which the command
was marched. At once the animal fell, fastening
the rider to the ground by his whole weight. His
brigade had been drilled to such a state of insensibility,
that not one of them came to his assistance; nor was it
necessary. The line advanced to within about ten
feet of him, when, in a loud, distinct voice, calmly as
if he had been in the saddle under no unusual circumstance,
Major Kearny gave the command, “<span class='it'>Fourth
company—obstacle—march.</span>” The fourth company,
which was immediately in front of him, was flanked
by its captain in the rear of the other half of the grand
division. The line passed on, and when he was thus
left in the rear of his men, he gave the command,
“<span class='it'>Fourth company into line—march.</span>” He was not
seriously injured—extricated himself from his horse,
mounted again, passed to the front of the regiment, and
executed the next manœuvre in the series he had
marked out for the day’s drill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are now, however, to see Major Kearny in a
new and more important sphere of action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the whole of the last war with Great Britain
cavalry was not once employed as a battle-piece, and
in spite of the great services of the horse which had been
commanded, during the revolution, by Cols. Lee and
Washington, and by Count Pulaski, this great arm had
become most unpopular. Consequently, on the reduction,
no skeleton even of a corps had been retained—the
sabres were locked up, the saddles and horses sold, and
the officers and men disbanded. The policy, however,
of disposing the eastern tribes along the western frontier,
and the rapid strides of emigration west ward, brought the
army into contact with the mounted tribes of the prairie,
who evidently could never be overtaken or punished
for depredations they at that time used to commit, by
foot-soldiers, armed with heavy muskets, and laden
down with knapsacks and camp equipage. Of this
evident proof had been obtained in the expedition of
Gen. Atkinson, mentioned above, and other excursions
which had brought the officers and men of the 6th, 3rd
and 1st infantry into contact with the nomad tribes of
the Camanch. If other demonstration were required,
it was furnished by the events of the Black Hawk war,
when it became necessary to raise a body of mounted
gunmen for special service, which was done under the
auspices of the present distinguished Senator from Wisconsin,
Mr. Dodge. These troops, called Rangers, did
good service enough to induce Congress to authorize
the levy of a strict cavalry corps called Dragoons. The
whole army, with very few exceptions, was impressed
with the necessity of this corps, for which the most
distinguished men in their several grades of the service
applied. On its organization, Major Kearny was appointed
lieutenant-colonel of the regiment, and on him
depended almost exclusively the discipline, the colonel,
Dodge, though a brave man, not having the military
education or experience requisite to make him
the active head of a new corps, in the details of which
not only men but officers were to be instructed. Col.
Kearny, during his long seclusion in the west, had
been a patient student, and had made himself master
of all the theory of his profession, and in a short time
made his regiment one of the best in the world. Within
less than a year after the first muster of the regiment,
it was sent, under its colonel, as a part of the command
with which the lamented Gen. Leavenworth marched
to the Spanish Peaks. This disastrous march, in the
course of which so many men and officers died, was
most trying to a new corps, which had no guide to direct
them. Here all the experience of the old world
was at fault. Cavalry had there to march but from
one hamlet to another, finding forage and grain everywhere.
Here eight hundred miles of wilderness were
to be overcome, and more than once the jaded horses
were without even water. This proved the perfectness
of the regiment, and the thoroughness of the discipline
which induced the gallant and veteran Gen.
Gaines to speak, in an official letter, of the first dragoons
as “the best troops I ever saw;” and the officer who
had defended Fort Erie, beaten back a victorious enemy
at Chrysler’s Field, and received the keys of St.
Augustine, certainly knew what a soldier was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1835, Col. Kearny visited with one wing of his
regiment, the Sioux, on the Upper Missouri, and had
the satisfaction at a council to reconcile the long animosity
between them and the Sauks and Foxes. He
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>
also made a long march to the head-waters of the Mississippi,
visiting the village of Wabisha, and effecting
a cessation of the trespassing of the British subjects,
from the Earl of Selkirk’s settlement at Pembina, on the
territories of the United States. In July, 1836, he was
made colonel of the first dragoons; and from this period
a sketch of his services would be almost a history of
the West, not one trouble on the frontier occurred in
the settlement of which he was not instrumental; and
with six companies of his regiment he was able to
protect a line of frontier eight hundred miles long.
Stationed at Fort Leavenworth, be made himself the
idol of the West, and devoting himself to his regiment,
made its discipline perfect. He had now acquired a
high rank, and the qualities he had always possessed
became conspicuous. Bland in his manners, but of
iron firmness, kind to his juniors, his equals, or those
nearly so, requiring the strictest obedience, measuring
his expectations by the rank of the officer, his conduct
became proverbial. To his men he was most considerate,
so that they looked on him as a protector. It
is believed that during the whole time he commanded
the first dragoons no soldier ever received a blow, except
by the sentence of a general court martial for the
infamous crime of desertion. The lash disappeared,
and though probably the strictest disciplinarian in the
service, there was less punishment in his corps than
in any other. About this time the system of drill
of the dragoons was changed, and he was long engrossed
in the instruction of his regiment, having the
troublesome task of unlearning them all he had taught
of the old system, from which the new one differed
entirely in mode and principle of combination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the year 1839, the two Ridges, father and son, and
Elias Boudinot, chiefs of the Cherokees, were murdered
by a hostile clique of their own tribe, and there
seemed imminent danger that a war would originate.
Immediately on the receipt of the news of a possible
collision, Col. Kearny determined to proceed to the
scene. The officer of the quarter-master’s department
on duty with him being unable to furnish the requisite
funds, the colonel provided them from his own resources,
and after a very rapid march appeared with
six companies of his regiment at Fort Wayne. Words
can not express the difference between his companies
and those in garrison at that post; the beautiful
condition of the men and horses of the first, and the
rough-coated nags and unclean condition of the men
of the second. After the difficulty had gone by, he
effected an exchange of garrisons, and with the neglected
and abused left wing, proceeded to <a id='leaven'></a>Fort Leavenworth,
where, in a short time these companies became equal
in discipline to the others of the corps. The companies
of the Fort Wayne garrison which he took with
him to Leavenworth, were those which, under the
command of the gallant and lamented Capt. Burgwin,
and the excellent soldier, Major Grier, did such good
service, and so much distinguished themselves in the
campaign in New Mexico against the revolters and the
Pueblo and Navajo Indians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1842, he was appointed to the command of the third
military department, with head-quarters at St. Louis.
There he remained until 1846, with the exception of
his long march to the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains
in 1845. There is no doubt that this is one of
the most extraordinary marches on record, both from
its distance, its rapidity, and the fact that he passed
among semi-hostile tribes nearly two thousand miles;
crossed deep and rapid streams by swimming, gave
protection to the immense army of emigrants <span class='it'>en route</span>
to California, and returned without losing a man or
horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1846, the war with Mexico began, and he was
assigned to the command of the army of the West with
orders to occupy New Mexico and California. To
reach Santa Fe an immense march was to be undertaken
across a country but sparsely furnished with wood
and water, and where no supplies were to be met with
or obtained until the enemy’s country should be
reached, and in all probability a battle fought and won.
To accomplish this, precisely such a man as Col.
Kearny was required. He was familiar with the
service, and possessed the unbounded confidence of the
people of Missouri, from which state the volunteers
who were to compose the main body of his army were
to be drawn. In a most unprecedented short time the
men were enrolled, and all necessaries supplied, and
before Armijo, the governor of New Mexico was
aware of his approach, the army was in the capital of
the province. Like Cæsar, Gen. Kearny might say,
“I came, I saw, I conquered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately before the capture of Santa Fe, Col.
Kearny had received his promotion to the grade of
Brigadier-General, and abandoned to his successor the
standard of a regiment he had borne from the Gulf
of Mexico to the head-waters of the Mississippi, and
which was to be the first flag of the army which
waved on the shores of the Pacific. After obeying
his orders, and providing for the future peace of the
country, he proceeded to California, across a country
where an army had never marched before, and which
was considered impassable. Cold, a wilderness, absolute
barrenness, were all to be overcome. Scarcely,
however, had he set out on this expedition than he
was met by an express, informing him that California
was conquered. Relying on this, he sent back all his
troops except one hundred men, and proceeded to the
valley of the Gila. Of the sufferings of his men, of the
almost starvation which forced them to eat the flesh of
the emaciated dragoon-horses which had borne them so
far we will not speak. When he emerged into the fertile
country, it was not until after severe contests against
immense odds, and until he had lost many favorite
officers and picked men, to all of whom he had become
endeared by participation in the dangers of a march
across the American continent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 2d of December, 1846, Gen. Kearny arrived
at Warner’s Rancho, one of the extreme eastward
settlements of California. He there learned certainly
what he had previously heard from a party of Californians,
that the population had risen against the invaders
and that Andreas Pico was near San Diego
with a superior party, intending to give him battle.
Though exhausted by a long march, and mounted on
broken-down mules, Gen. Kearny hurried to attack
him. On the night of December 5, he heard that Pico
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
was at the village of San Pascual, and on the next
morning met him. At once a charge was ordered,
which broke Pico’s line and forced it to retreat. After
a flight of half a mile, however, it was rallied and
charged the head of the American force, and lanced
many of the foremost men. A desperate hand to hand
fight ensued, which resulted in the discomfiture of Pico,
not, however, until Captains Moore and Johnston, and
Lieutenant Hammond, and sixteen men had been
killed, and fourteen persons wounded, including the
general himself, and all the officers except Captain
Turner, who, though he greatly distinguished himself,
escaped untouched. The inequality of the contest
was immense, when we remember that the Californians,
the most superb horsemen in the world, were
mounted on excellent chargers, while the dragoons
were on mules which had marched from Santa Fe.
The dead were buried; this sad duty, and the necessity
of making further arrangements, detained the party
all day. On the next day the march was resumed,
but encumbered as they were, they were able to
proceed but nine miles when the enemy charged them
again. The needful preparations to receive them were
made, when the enemy wheeled off, and attempted to
occupy an eminence which commanded the route.
From this, after a sharp skirmish, they were driven
with some loss, and then Gen. Kearny encamped.
As Pico evidently intended to dispute every pass, the
general determined to remain where he was until reinforcements,
for which he had sent to the naval commander
at San Diego, should arrive. Four days afterward
a force of marines, under Capt. Zelin, U. S. M. C.
and of sailors, commanded by Lieutenant Gray, arrived,
and with this force Gen. Kearny marched without
molestation to San Diego, a distance of thirty miles.
A difficulty about the command here arose between
Commodore Stockton and Gen. Kearny, which could
not be settled in California, where the naval commander
had far the superior force. It did not prevent
their undertaking a joint expedition against Puebla de
los Angelos, which was in possession of a strong
Mexican force under Flores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 8th of January the Mexicans were met six hundred
strong, with four guns, in the face of whom the
American force of sailors, marines, and the remnant of
the dragoons, forded the river, and after a short, sharp,
and decisive affair, drove them from the field. On the
next day the enemy again appeared, and, as usual, were
beaten, and on the 10th Puebla de los Angelos was occupied.
At these affairs both the naval and army commanders
were present, and the question of who was
commander added somewhat to the difficulty already
existing between them. At this time Lieut. Col. J. C.
Fremont, then of the mounted rifles, commanded a numerous
body of volunteers in California. Gen. Kearny
ordered this officer to join him. This Col. Fremont did
not do, but on the contrary, considered Com. Stockton
as his commander. Consequently, when on the arrival
of land reinforcements from the United States, Gen.
Kearny assumed and maintained his command, he
ordered Col. Fremont to accompany him home. Col.
Fremont was subsequently arrested and tried for this
dereliction of duty, found guilty of mutinous conduct,
and sentenced to be dismissed the service. A portion
of the court which tried him having recommended the
remission of the sentence, the President acquiesced, and
he was ordered to duty, but immediately resigned his
commission. The prosecution of the charges against
Col. Fremont detained Gen. Kearny in Washington
during a portion of the winter of ’47 and ’48, and was,
doubtless, most painful to him, for no man in the army
had previously borne a higher character for soldiership
than Col. Fremont. The court martial fully sustained
Gen. Kearny in every pretension, and but one
person has been found in America to cavil at the
sentence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the spring of 1848, Gen. Kearny was ordered to
Mexico, whither he proceeded at once. All hostilities
were, however, then over, and though he was in the
discharge of his duty, his service there was uneventful.
On the conclusion of the war he returned home, and
was assigned to the command of the military division
of which St. Louis is the head-quarters. He there
had the proud satisfaction to receive the brevet of major-general
for his services in New Mexico and California.
He had, however, brought with him the seeds of an
insidious disease which soon overcame his strength,
enfeebled as it was by privations and trials of every
kind. He died at St. Louis, October 31, 1848, leaving
a wife and a family of young sons to regret him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the eventful career of Gen. Kearny he had always
been distinguished as one of the best officers of his
grade in the service. From a subaltern to the highest
rank he rose, every step having been won by service.
He was bland in his manners, dispassionate and calm.
Quick and ready in forming his opinions, he yet did
not act hastily, and when once he had decided, was
immutable in his course. A great student and thinker,
he never talked except when he had something to say,
yet possessed a fund of anecdote and universal information
rarely to be met with. In the West he was a
popular idol, so that the whole population acquiesced
in the apparently arbitrary steps he was often called on
to take in the discharge of his duty. To his subalterns
he was endeared by a thousand kindnesses, and to the
whole army by respect and admiration. He left in all
the army list no one superior to him in personal courage,
science in his profession, or the minor qualities which
contribute so much to make the soldier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately on the receipt of the news of his death,
the Secretary of War, Mr. Marcy, published an order
containing the following high tribute to his important
services.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'><span class='it'>Washington, Nov. 6, 1848.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The President with feelings of deep regret announces
to the Army the death of Brigadier-General Stephen
W. Kearny, Major-General by brevet. The honorable
and useful career of this gallant officer terminated
on the 31st of October at St. Louis, in consequence of
a disease contracted while in the discharge of his
official duties in Mexico.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Kearny entered the army in 1812 as lieutenant,
and continued in it until his death—a period of
more than thirty-six years. His character and bearing
as an accomplished officer were unsurpassed, and
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
challenge the admiration of his fellow citizens and the
emulation of his professional brethren. His conquest of
New Mexico and valuable services in California have
inseparably connected his name with the future destiny
of these territories, and it will be ever held in grateful
remembrance by the successive generations which will
inhabit these extensive regions of our confederacy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He was buried in St. Louis by the 7th and 8th regiments
of infantry and a squadron of that regiment of
dragoons which he had made so famous, commanded
by one of his favorite captains, the present Col. E. V.

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY HENRY WILLIAM HERBERT.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In the commencement of the seventeenth century,
there stood among the woody hills and romantic gorges
which sweep southwardly down from the bleak expanse
of Dartmoor, one of those fine old English halls,
which, dating from the reign of the last of the Tudors,
united so much of modern comfort with so much of
antique architectural beauty. Many specimens of this
style of building are still to be found scattered throughout
England, with their broad terraces, their quaintly
sculptured porticoes, their tall projecting oriels, their
many stacks of richly decorated chimneys, and their
heraldic bearings adorning every salient point, grotesquely
carved in the red freestone, which is their
most usual, as indeed their most appropriate material.
No one, however, existed, it is probable, at that day,
more perfect in proportion to its size, or more admirably
suited to its wild and romantic site, than the
manor-house of Widecomb-Under-Moor, or, as it was
more generally called in its somewhat sequestered
neighborhood, the House in the Woods. Even at the
present time, that is a very rural and little frequented
district; its woods are more extensive, its moorlands
wilder, its streams less often turned to purposes of
manufacturing utility, than in any other tract of the
southern counties; but at the time of which I write,
when all England was comparatively speaking an
agricultural country; when miles and miles of forest
existed, where there now can scarcely be found acres;
when the communications even between the neighboring
country towns were difficult and tedious, and those
between the country and metropolis almost impracticable;
the region of Dartmoor and its surrounding
woodlands was less known and less frequented, except
by its own inhabitants, rude for the most part and uncultured
as their native hills, than the prairies of the
Far West, or the solitudes of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The few gentry, and lords of manors who owned
estates, and had their castellated or Elizabethan dwellings,
scattered here and there, at long intervals, among
the sylvan scenery of that lonely region, were for the
greater part little superior in habits, in refinement, and
in mental culture, to the boors around them. Staunch
hunters, and hard drinkers, up with the lark and abed
before the curfew, loyal to their king, kind and liberal
to their dependents, and devout before their God, they
led obscure and blameless lives, careless of the great
world, a rumor of which rarely wandered so far as to
reach their ears, unknown to fame, yet neither useless
nor unhonored within the sphere of their humble influence,
marked by few faults and many unpretending
virtues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this general rule, however, the lords of Widecomb
Manor had long been an exception. Endowed
with larger territorial possessions than most of their
neighbors, connected with many of the noblest families
of the realm, the St. Aubyns of Widecomb Manor
had for several generations held themselves high above
the squires of the vicinity, and the burghers of the circumjacent
towns. Not confining themselves to the
remote limits of their rural possessions, many of them
had shone in the court and in the camp; several had
held offices of trust and honor under Elizabeth and
her successor; and when, in the reign of the unfortunate
Charles, the troubles between the king and his
Parliament broke out at length into open war, the St.
Aubyn of that day, like many another gallant gentleman,
emptied his patrimonial coffers to replenish the
exhausted treasury; and melted his old plate and felled
his older oaks, in order to support the king’s cause in
the field, at the head of his own regiment of horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thence, when the good cause succumbed for a time,
and democratic license, hardly restrained by puritanic
rigor, strode rampant over the prerogative of England’s
crown, and the liberties of England’s people, fines,
sequestrations, confiscations, fell heavily on the confirmed
malignancy, as it was then termed, of the Lord
of Widecomb; and he might well esteem himself fortunate,
that he escaped beyond the seas with his head
upon his shoulders, although he certainly had not
where to lay it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Returning at the restoration with the Second Charles,
more fortunate than many of his friends, Sir Miles St.
Aubyn recovered a considerable portion of his demesnes,
which, though sequestrated, had not been sold,
and with these the old mansion, now, alas! all too
grand and stately for the diminished revenues of its
owner, and the shrunken estates which it overlooked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would not perhaps have been too late, even then
for prudence and economy, joined to a resolute will
and energetic purpose, to retrieve the shaken fortunes
of the house; but having recovered peace and a settled
government, the people and the court of England
appeared simultaneously to have lost their senses.
The overstrained and somewhat hypocritical morality
of the Protectorate was succeeded by the wildest
license, the most extravagant debauchery; and in the
orgies which followed their restoration to their patrimonial
honors, too many of the gallant cavaliers discreditably
squandered the last remnant of fortunes
which had been half ruined in a cause so noble and
so holy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the fate of Sir Miles St. Aubyn. The
brave and generous soldier of the First Charles sank
into the selfish, dissipated roysterer under his unworthy
successor. He never visited again the beautiful
oak-woods and sparkling waters of his native place,
but frittered away a frivolous and useless life among
the orgies of Alsatia and the revels of Whitehall; and
died, unfriended, and almost alone, leaving an only
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>
son, who had scarce seen his father, the heir to his impoverished
fortunes and little honored name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His son, who was born before the commencement
of the troubles, of a lady highly-bred, and endowed as
highly, who died—as the highly endowed die but too
often—in the first prime of womanhood, was already
a man when the restoration brought his father back to
his native land, though not to his patrimonial estates or
his paternal duties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miles St. Aubyn, the younger, had been educated
during the period of the civil war, and during the protracted
absence of his father, by a distant maternal
relative, whose neutrality and humble position alike
protected him from persecution by either of the hostile
parties. He grew up, like his race, strong, active,
bold and gallant; and if he had not received much of
that peculiar nurture which renders men graceful and
courtly-mannered, almost from their cradles, he was
at least educated under the influence of those traditional
principles which make them at the bottom, even
if they lack something of external polish, high-souled
and honorable gentlemen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the restoration he was sent abroad, as was the
habit of the day, to push his fortunes with his sword
in the Netherlands, then, as in all ages of the world,
the chosen battle-ground of nations. There he served
many years, if not with high distinction, at least with
credit to his name; and if he did not win high fortune
with his sword—and indeed the day for such winnings
had already passed in Europe—he at least enjoyed the
advantage of mingling, during his adventurous career,
with the great, the noble, and the famous of the age;
and when, on his return to his native land after his
father’s death, he turned his sword into a ploughshare,
and sought repose among the old staghorned oaks at
Widecomb, he was no longer the enthusiastic, wild
and headstrong youth of twenty years before; but a
grave, polished, calm, accomplished man, with something
of Spanish dignity and sternness engrafted on the
frankness of his English character, and with the self-possession
of one used familiarly to courts and camps
showing itself in every word and motion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a man moreover of worth, energy and resolution,
and sitting down peacefully under the shadow
of his own woods, he applied himself quietly, but with
an iron steadiness of purpose that ensured success, to
retrieving in some degree the fortunes of his race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after he returned he had taken unto himself a
wife, not perhaps very wisely chosen from a family of
descent prouder and haughtier even than his own, and
of fortunes if not as much impoverished, at least so
greatly diminished, as to render the lady’s dower a
matter merely nominal. But it was an old affection—a
long promise, hallowed by love and constancy and
honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was, moreover, a beautiful and charming creature,
and, so long as she lived, rendered the old soldier
a very proud and very happy husband, and when she
died—which, most unhappily for all concerned, was
but a few months after giving birth to an only son—left
him so comfortless, and at the same time so wedded
to the memory of the dead, that he never so much
as envisaged the idea of a second marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This gentleman it was, who, many long years after
the death of the gentle Lady Alice, dwelt in serene and
dignified seclusion in the old Hall, which he had never
quitted since he became a widower; devoting his
whole abilities to nursing his dilapidated estates, and
educating his only son, whom he regarded with affection
bordering on idolatry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the last Miles St. Aubyn, however, we shall
have little to do henceforth, for the soldier of the
Netherlands had departed so far from the traditions of
his family—the eldest son of which had for generations
borne the same name of Miles—as to drop that patrimonial
appellation in the person of his son, whom he
had caused to be christened Jasper, after a beloved
friend, a brother of the lady afterward his wife, who
had fallen by his side on a well-fought field in the
Luxembourg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was the cause which induced the veteran, in
other respects so severe a stickler for ancient habitudes,
to swerve from this time-honored custom, it
would be difficult to state; some of those who knew
him best, attributing it merely to the desire of perpetuating
the memory of his best friend in the person of
his only child; while others ascribed it to a sort of
superstitious feeling, which, attaching the continued
decline of the house to the continual recurrence of the
patronymic, looked forward in some degree to a revival
of its honors with a new name to its lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever might have been the cause, the consequences
of this deviation from old family usage, as
prognosticated by the dependents of Widecomb, and
the superstitious inhabitants of the neighboring woods
and wolds, were any thing but likely to better the fortunes
of the lords of the manor; for not a few of them
asserted, with undoubting faith, that the last St. Aubyn
had seen the light of day, and that in the same generation
which had seen the extinction of the old name the
old race should itself pass away. Nor did they lack
some sage authority to which they might refer for confirmation
of their dark forebodings; for there existed,
living yet in the mouths of men, one of those ancient
saws, which were so common a century or two ago in
the rural districts of England, as connected with the
fortunes of the old houses; and which were referred
to some Mother Shipton, or other equally infallible
soothsayer of the county, whose dicta to the vulgar
minds of the feudal tenantry were confirmations strong
as proofs of Holy Writ.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prophecy in question was certainly exceeding
old; and had been handed down through many generations,
by direct oral tradition, among a race of men
wholly illiterate and uneducated; to whom perhaps
alone, owing to the long expatriation of the late and
present lords of the manor, it was now familiar;
although in past times it had doubtless been accredited
by the family to which it related.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It ran as follows, and, not being deficient in a sort of
wild harmony and rugged solemnity, produced, by no
means unnaturally, a powerful effect on the minds of
hearers, when recited in awe-stricken tones and with
a bended brow beside some feebly glimmering hearth,
in the lulls of the tempest haply raving without,
among the leafless trees, under the starless night—It
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>
ran as follows, and, universally believed by the vassals
of the house, it remains for us to see how far its predictions
were confirmed by events, and how far it influenced
or foretold the course of passion, or the course
of fate⁠—</p>

<hr class='tbk109'/>

<p class='pindent'>Thus far it has been necessary for us to tread back
the path of departed generations, and to retrace the
fortunes of the Widecomb family, inasmuch as many
of the events, which we shall have to narrate hereafter,
and very much of the character of the principal
personage, to whom our tale relates, have a direct relation
to these precedents, and would have been to a
certain degree incomprehensible but for this retrogression.
If it obtain no other end, it will serve at least
to explain how, amid scenes so rural and sequestered,
and dwelling almost in solitude, among neighbors so
rugged and uncivilized, there should have been found
a family, deprived of all advantages of intercommunication
with equals or superiors in intellect and demeanor,
and even unassisted by the humanizing influence
of familiar female society, which had yet maintained,
as if traditionally, all the principles, all the
ideas, and all the habitudes of the brightest schools of
knightly courtesy and gentlemanly bearing, all the
graces and easy dignity of courts, among the remote
solitudes of the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the time when our narrative commences, the
soldier of the Netherlands, Sir Miles St. Aubyn—for
though he cared not to bear a foreign title, he had been
stricken a knight banneret on a bloody battle-field of
Flanders—had fallen long into the sere, the yellow leaf;
and though his cheek was still ruddy as a winter pippin,
his eye bright and clear, and his foot firm as ever,
his hair was as white as the drifted snow; his arm had
lost its nervous power; and if his mind was still sane
and his body sound, he was now more addicted to sit
beside the glowing hearth in winter, or to bask in the
summer sunshine, poring over some old chronicle or
antique legend, than to wake the echoes of the oakwoods
with his bugle-horn, or to rouse the heathcock
from the heathy moorland with his blythe springers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not so, however, the child of his heart, Jasper. The
boy on whom such anxious pains had been bestowed,
on whom hopes so intense reposed, had reached his
seventeenth summer. Like all his race, he was unusually
tall, and admirably formed, both for agility and
strength. Never, from his childhood upward, having
mingled with any persons of vulgar station or unpolished
demeanor, he was, as if by nature, graceful and
easy. His manners although proud, and marked by
something of that stern dignity which we have mentioned
as a characteristic of the father, but which in
one so youthful appeared strange and out of place,
were ever those of a high and perfect gentleman. His
features were marked with all the ancestral beauties,
which may be traced in unmixed races through so
many generations; and as it was a matter of notorious
truth, that from the date of the conquest, no drop of
Saxon or of Celtic blood had been infused into the pure
Norman stream which flowed through the veins of the
proud St. Aubyns, it was no marvel that after the lapse
of so many ages the youthful Jasper should display,
both in face and form, the characteristic lines and
coloring peculiar to the noblest tribe of men that has
ever issued from the great northern hive of nations.
Accordingly, he had the rich dark chestnut hair, not
curled, but waving in loose clusters; the clear gray
eye; the aquiline nose; the keen and fiery look; the
resolute mouth, and the iron jaw, which in all ages
have belonged to the descendant of the Northman.
While the spare yet sinewy frame, the deep, round
chest, thin flanks, and limbs long and muscular and singularly
agile, were not less perfect indications of his
blood than the sharp, eagle-like expression of the bold
countenance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trained in his early boyhood to all those exercises
of activity and strength, which were in those days held
essential to the gentleman, it needs not to say that Jasper
St. Aubyn could ride, swim, fence, shoot, run,
leap, pitch the bar, and go through every manœuvre
of the <span class='it'>salle d’armes</span>, the tilt-yard, and the <span class='it'>manège</span>,
with equal grace and power. Nor had his lighter accomplishments
been neglected; for the age of his
father and grandfather, if profligate and dissolute even
to debauchery, was still refined and polished, and to
dance gracefully, and touch the lute or sing tastefully,
was as much expected from the cavalier as to have a
firm foot in the stirrup, or a strong and supple wrist
with the backsword and rapier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mind had been richly stored also, if not very
sagely trained and regulated. For Sir Miles, in the
course of his irregular and adventurous life, had read
much more than he had meditated; had picked up
much more of learning than he had of philosophy; and
what philosophy he had belonged much more to the
cold self-reliance of the camp than to the sounder
tenets of the schools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While filling his son’s mind, therefore, with much
curious lore of all sorts; while making him a master
of many tongues, and laying before him books of all
kinds, the old banneret had taken little pains—perhaps
he would not have succeeded had he taken more—to
point the lessons which the books contained; to draw
deductions from the facts which he inculcated; or to
direct the course of the young man’s opinions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Self-taught himself, or taught only in the hard school
of experience, and having himself arrived at sound
principles of conduct, he never seemed to recollect
that the boy would run through no such ordeal, and
reap no such lessons; nor did he ever reflect that the
deductions which he had himself drawn from certain
facts, acquired in one way, and under one set of circumstances,
would probably be entirely different from
those at which another would arrive, when his data
were acquired in a very different manner, and under
circumstances altogether diverse and dissimilar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thence it came that Jasper St. Aubyn, at the age of
seventeen years, was in all qualities of body thoroughly
trained and disciplined; and in all mental faculties perfectly
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
educated, but entirely untrained, uncorrected and
unchastened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In manner, he was a perfect gentleman; in body, he
was a perfect man; in mind, he was almost a perfect
scholar. And what, our reader will perhaps inquire,
what could he have been more; or what more could
education have effected in his behalf?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much—very much—good friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For as there is an education of the body, and an
education of the brain, so is there also an education of
the heart. And that is an education which men rarely
have the faculty of imparting, and which few men
ever have obtained, who have not enjoyed the inestimable
advantage of female nurture during their youth,
as well as their childhood; unless they have learned
it in the course of painful years, from those severe and
bitter teachers, those chasteners and purifiers of the
heart—sorrow and suffering, which two <span class='it'>are</span> experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, then, was the education in which Jasper St.
Aubyn was altogether deficient; which Sir Miles had
never so much as attempted to impart to him; and
which, had he endeavored, he probably would have
failed to bestow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We do not mean to say that the boy was heartless—boys
rarely are so, we might almost say never—nor
that the impulses of his heart were toward evil rather
than good; far from it. His heart, like all young and
untainted hearts, was full of noble impulses—but they
were <span class='it'>impulses</span>; full of fresh springing generous desires,
of gracious sympathies and lofty aspirations—but
he had not one principle—he never had been taught
to question one impulse, before acting upon it—he
never had learned to check one desire, to doubt the
genuineness of one sympathy, to moderate the eagerness
of one aspiration. He never had been brought to
suspect that there were such virtues as self-control, or
self-devotion; such vices as selfishness or self-abandonment—in
a word, he never had so much as heard</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>and therefore he was, at the day of which we write,
even what he was; and thereafter, what we propose
to show you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the time when the youthful heir had attained his
seventeenth year, the great object of his father’s life
was accomplished; the fortunes of the family were so
far at least retrieved, that if the St. Aubyns no longer
aspired, as of old, to be the first or wealthiest family
of the county, they were at least able to maintain the
household on that footing of generous liberality and
hospitable ease which has been at all times the pride
and passion of the English country gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For many years Sir Miles had undergone the severest
privations, and it was only by the endurance of
actual poverty within doors, that he was enabled to
maintain that footing abroad, without which he could
scarcely have preserved his position in society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For many years the park had been neglected, the
gardens overrun with weeds and brambles, the courts
grass-grown, and the house itself dilapidated, literally
from the impossibility of supporting domestics sufficiently
numerous to perform the necessary labors of
the estate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During much of this period it was to the beasts of
the forest, the fowl of the moorland, and the fish of the
streams, that the household of Widecomb had looked
for their support; nor did the table of the banneret
himself boast any liquor more generous than that
afforded by the ale vats of March and October.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout the whole of this dark and difficult time,
however, the stout old soldier had never suffered one
particle of that ceremonial, which he deemed essential
as well to the formation as the preservation of the
character of a true gentleman, to be relaxed or neglected
by his diminished household.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Personally, he was at all times clad point device;
nor did he ever fail in being mounted, himself and at
least one attendant, as became a cavalier of honor.
The hours of the early dinner, and of the more agreeable
and social supper, were announced duly by the
clang of trumpets, even when there were no guests to
be summoned, save the old banneret and his motherless
child, and perhaps the only visiter for years at
Widecomb Manor, the gray-haired vicar of the village,
who had served years before as chaplain of an English
regiment in the Low Countries, with Sir Miles. Nor
was the pewter tankard, containing at the best but
toast and ale, stirred with a sprig of rosemary, handed
around the board with less solemnity than had it been a
golden hanap mantling with the first vintages of Burgundy
or Xeres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it was that, as Jasper advanced gradually toward
years of manhood, the fortunes of the house improving
in proportion to his growth, seeing no alteration
in the routine of the household, he scarcely was
aware that any change had taken place in more essential
points.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eye and ear of the child had been taken by the
banners, the trumpets, and the glittering board, and his
fancy riveted by the solemnity and grave decorum
which characterized the meals partaken in the great
hall; and naturally enough he never knew that the
pewter platters and tankards had been exchanged,
since those days, for plate of silver, and the strong ale
converted into claret or canary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The consequence of this was simply that he found
himself a youth of seventeen, surrounded by all the
means and appliances of luxury, with servants, horses,
hounds, and falcons at his command, the leading personage,
beyond all comparison, of the neighborhood,
highly born, handsome, well bred and accomplished.
All this, by the way, was entirely uncorrected by any
memory of past sufferings or sorrows, either on his
own part or on that of his family, or by any knowledge
of the privations and exertions on the part of Sir
Miles, by which this present affluence had been purchased;
and he became, naturally enough, somewhat
over confident in his own qualities, somewhat over-bearing
in his manner, and not a little intolerant and
inconsiderate as to the opinions and feelings of others.
He then presented, in a word, the not unusual picture
of an arrogant, self-sufficient, proud and fiery youth,
with many generous and noble points, and many high
qualities, which, duly cultivated, might have rendered
him a good, a happy, and perhaps even a great man;
but which, untrained as they were, and suffered to
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
run up into a rank and unpruned overgrowth, were
but too likely to degenerate themselves into vices, and
to render him at some future day a tormentor of himself,
and an oppressor of others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, however, he was a general favorite, for largely
endowed with animal spirits, indulged in every wish
that his fancy could form, never crossed in the least
particular, it was rarely that his violent temper would
display itself, or his innate selfishness rise conspicuous
above the superficial face of good-nature and somewhat
careless affability, which he presented to the general
observer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, perhaps, unfortunate for Jasper, no less than
for those who were in after days connected with him,
whether for good or evil, that, at this critical period of
his adolescence, when the character of the man is developed
from the accidents of boyhood, in proportion
as his increasing years and altered habits and pursuits
led him to be more abroad, and cast him in some degree
into the world, the advancing years and growing
infirmities of his father kept him closer to the library
and the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So that at the very time when his expanding mind
and nascent passions most needed sage advice and
moderate coercion, or at least wary guidance, he was
abandoned almost entirely to his own direction. The
first outbreaks, therefore, of evil principles, the germs
of a masterful will, the seeds of fierce and fiery passions,
and, above all, the growing recklessness with
regard to the feelings and the rights of others, which
could scarcely have escaped the notice of the shrewd
old man had he accompanied his son abroad, and which,
if noticed, would surely have been repressed, were
allowed to increase hourly by self-indulgence and the
want of restraint, unknown and unsuspected to the
youth himself, for whom one day they were to be the
cause of so many and so bitter trials.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is now time that, turning from this brief retrospect
of previous events, and this short analysis of the
early constitution of the mind of him whose singular
career is to form the subject of this narrative, we should
introduce our reader to the scene of action, and to the
person whose adventures in after life will perhaps excuse
the space which has necessarily been allotted to
the antecedents of the first marked event which befel
him, and from which all the rest took their rise in a
train of connection, which, although difficult to trace
by a casual observer, was in reality close and perfect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The manor-house of Widecomb, such as it has been
slightly sketched above, stood on a broad flat terrace,
paved with slabs of red freestone, and adorned with a
massive balustrade of the same material, interspersed
with grotesque images at the points where it was
reached from the esplanade below, by three or four
flights of broad and easy steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mansion itself was large, and singularly picturesque,
but the beauties of the building were as nothing
to those of the scenery which it overlooked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was built on the last and lowest slope of one of
those romantic spurs which trend southerly from the
wild and heathery heights of Dartmoor. And although
the broad and beautifully kept lawn was embosomed
in a very woody and sylvan chase, full of deep glens
and tangled dingles, which was in turn framed on three
sides by the deep oak-woods, which covered all the
rounded hills in the rear of the estate and to the right
and left hand, yet as the land continued to fall toward
the south for many and many a mile, the sight could
range from the oriel windows of the great hall, and of
the fine old library, situated on either hand of the entrance
and armory, over a wide expanse of richly cultivated
country, with more than one navigable river
winding among the woods and corn-fields, and many a
village steeple glittering among the hedgerows, until in
the far distance it was bounded by a blue hazy line,
which seemed to melt into the sky, but which was in
truth, though not to be distinguished as such unless by
a practiced eye, the British Channel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hall itself and even the southern verge of the
chase, which bounded the estate in that direction, lay,
however, at a very considerable distance from the cultivated
country, and was divided from it by a vast
broken chasm, with banks so precipitous and rocky
that no road had ever been carried through it, while
its great width had deterred men from the idea of
bridging it. Through this strange and terrific gorge
there rushed an impetuous and powerful torrent, broken
by many falls and rapids, with many a deep and limpid
pool between them, favorite haunts of the large salmon
and sea trout which abounded in its waters. This
brook, for it scarcely can be called a river, although
after the rains of autumn or the melting snows of
spring it sent down an immense volume of dark, rust
colored water, with a roar that could be heard for
miles, to the distant Tamar, swept down the hills in a
series of cascades from the right hand side of the park,
until it reached the brink of the chasm we have described,
lying at right angles to its former course, down
which it plunged in an impetuous shoot of nearly three
hundred feet, and rushed thence easterly away, walled
on each side by the precipitous rock, until some five
miles thence it was crossed at a deep and somewhat
dangerous ford, by the only great road which traversed
that district, and by which alone strangers could reach
the Hall and its beautiful demesnes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the westward or right hand side of the chase the
country was entirely wild and savage, covered with
thick woods, interspersed with lonely heaths, and intersected
by hundreds of clear brawling rills. To the
eastward, however, although much broken by forest
ground, there was a wide range of rich pasture fields
and meadows, divided by great overgrown hawthorn
hedges, each hedge almost a thicket, and penetrated
by numerous lanes and horse-roads buried between
deep banks, and overcanopied by foliage, that, even at
noonday, was almost impenetrable to the sunshine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here and there lay scattered among the fields and
woods innumerable farm-houses and granges, the
abodes of small freeholders, once tenants and vassals
of the great St. Aubyns; and, at about six miles from
the Hall, nestled in a green valley, through which ran
a clear, bright trout-stream to join the turbulent torrent,
stood the little market town of Widecomb-Under-Moor,
from their unalienated property in which the
family of St. Aubyn derived the most valuable portion
of their incomes.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
Over the whole of this pleasant and peaceful tract,
whether it was still owned by themselves, or had
passed into the hands of the free yeomanry, the Lords
of Widecomb still held manorial rights, and the few
feudal privileges which had survived the revolution;
and, through the whole of it, Sir Miles St. Aubyn was
regarded with unmixed love and veneration, while the
boy Jasper was looked upon almost as a son in every
family, though some old men would shake their heads
doubtfully, and mutter sage but unregarded saws concerning
his present disposition and future prospects;
and some old grandames would prognosticate disasters,
horrors, and even crimes as hanging over his career,
in consequence, perhaps, of the inauspicious change in
the patronymic of his race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were a happy and an unsophisticated race
who inhabited those lonely glens. Sufficiently well
provided to be above the want of necessaries, or the
fear of poverty, they were not so far removed from the
necessity of labor as to have incurred vicious ambitions—moderate,
frugal, and industrious, they lived uncorrupted,
and died happy in their unlearned innocence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the boast of the district that bars and locks
were appendages to doors entirely unusual and useless;
that the cage of Widecomb had not held a tenant
since the days of stiff old Oliver; and that no deed of
violence or blood had ever tainted those calm vales
with horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas! how soon was that boast to be annulled; how
soon were the details of a dread domestic tragedy, full
of dark horrors, and reproductive of guilt through
generations, to render the very name of Widecomb a
terror, and to invest the beauteous scenery with images
of superstitious awe and hatred. But we must not
anticipate, nor seek as yet to penetrate the secrets of
that destiny, which even during the morn of promising
young life, seemed to overhang the house,</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as fair a morning of July as ever dawned in the
blue summer sky; the sun as yet had risen but a little
way above the waves of fresh green foliage which
formed the horizon of the woodland scenery surrounding
Widecomb Manor; and his heat, which promised
ere midday to become excessive, was tempered now
by the exhalations of the copious night-dews, and by
the cool breath of the western breeze, which came
down through the leafy gorges, in long, soft swells
from the open moorlands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All nature was alive and joyous; the air was vocal
with the piping melody of the blackbirds and thrushes,
caroling in every brake and bosky dingle; the smooth,
green lawn, before the windows of the old Hall was
peopled with whole tribes of fat, lazy hares, limping
about among the dewy herbage, fearless, as it would
seem, of man’s aggression; and to complete the picture,
above a score of splendid peacocks were strutting
to and fro on the paved terraces, or perched upon the
carved stone balustrades, displaying their gorgeous
plumage to the early sunshine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shadowy mists of the first morning twilight had
not been long dispersed from the lower regions, and
were suspended still in the middle air in broad fleecy
masses, though melting rapidly away in the increasing
warmth and brightness of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And still a faint blue line hovered over the bed of
the long rocky gorge, which divided the chase from
the open country, floating about it like the steam of a
seething caldron, and rising here and there into tall
smoke-like columns, probably where some steeper cataract
of the mountain-stream sent its foam skyward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So early, indeed, was the hour, that had my tale been
recited of these degenerate days, there would have
been no gentle eyes awake to look upon the loveliness
of new-awakened nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the good days of old, however, when daylight was
still deemed to be the fitting time for labor and for
pastime, and night the appointed time for natural and
healthful sleep, the dawn was wont to brighten beheld
by other eyes than those of clowns and milkmaids, and
the gay songs of the matutinal birds were listened to
by ears that could appreciate their untaught melodies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, just as the stable clock was striking four,
the great oaken door of the old Hall was thrown open
with a vigorous swing that made it rattle on its hinges,
and Jasper St. Aubyn came bounding out into the fresh
morning air, with a foot as elastic as that of the mountain
roe, singing a snatch of some quaint old ballad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was dressed simply in a close-fitting jacket and
tight hose of dark-green cloth, without any lace or
embroidery, light boots of untanned leather, and a
broad-leafed hat, with a single eagle’s feather thrust
carelessly through the band. He wore neither cloak
nor sword, though it was a period at which gentlemen
rarely went abroad without both these, their distinctive
attributes; but in the broad black belt which girt his
rounded waist he carried a stout wood-knife with a
buckhorn hilt; and over his shoulder there swung
from a leathern thong, a large wicker fishing-basket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing, indeed, could be simpler or less indicative
of any particular rank or station in society than young
St. Aubyn’s garb, yet it would have been a very dull
and unobservant eye which should take him for aught
less than a high-born and high-bred gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His fine intellectual face, his bearing erect before
heaven, the graceful ease of his every motion, as he
hurried down the flagged steps of the terrace, and
planted his light foot on the dewy greensward, all betokened
gentle birth and gentle associations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he thought nothing of himself, nor cared for his
advantages, acquired or natural. The long and heavy
salmon-rod which he carried in his right hand, in three
pieces as yet unconnected, did not more clearly indicate
his purpose than the quick marking glance which
he cast toward the half-veiled sun and hazy sky,
scanning the signs of the weather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will do, it will do,” he said to himself, thinking
as it were aloud, “for three or four hours at least; the
sun will not shake off those vapors before eight o’clock
at the earliest, and if he do come out then hot and
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>
strong, I do not know but the water is dark enough
after the late rains to serve my turn awhile longer. It
will blow up, too, I think, from the westward, and
there will be a brisk curl on the pools. But come, I
must be moving, if I would reach Darringford to breakfast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as he spoke he strode out rapidly across the
park toward the deep chasm of the stream, crushing a
thousand aromatic perfumes from the dewy wild-flowers
with his heedless foot, and thinking little of
the beauties of nature, as he hastened to the scene of
his loved exercise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not long, accordingly, before he reached the
brink of the steep rocky bank above the stream, which
he proposed to fish that morning, and paused to select
the best place for descending to the water’s edge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, indeed, a striking and romantic scene as ever
met the eye of painter or of poet. On the farther side
of the gorge, scarcely a hundred yards distant, the
dark limestone rocks rose sheer and precipitous from
the very brink of the stream, rifted and broken into
angular blocks and tall columnar masses, from the
clefts of which, wherever they could find soil enough
to support their scanty growth, a few stunted oaks
shot out almost horizontally with their gnarled arms
and dark-green foliage, and here and there the silvery
bark and quivering tresses of the birch relieved the
monotony of color by their gay brightness. Above,
the cliffs were crowned with the beautiful purple
heather, now in its very glow of summer bloom, about
which were buzzing myriads of wild bees sipping
their nectar from its cups of amethyst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hither side, though rough and steep and broken,
was not in the place where Jasper stood precipitous;
indeed it seemed as if at some distant period a sort of
landslip had occurred, by which the fall of the rocky
wall had been broken into massive fragments, and
hurled down in an inclined plane into the bed of the
stream, on which it had encroached with its shattered
blocks and rounded boulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time, however, had covered all this abrupt and
broken slope with a beautiful growth of oak and hazel
coppice, among which, only at distant intervals, could
the dun weather-beaten flanks of the great stones be
discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the base of this descent, a hundred and fifty feet
perhaps below the stand of the young sportsman,
flowed the dark arrowy stream—a wild and perilous
water. As clear as crystal, yet as dark as the brown
cairn-gorm, it came pouring down among the broken
rocks with a rapidity and force which showed what
must be its fury when swollen by a storm among the
mountains, here breaking into wreaths of rippling foam
where some unseen ledge chafed its current, there
roaring and surging white as December’s snow among
the great round-headed rocks, and there again wheeling
in sullen eddies, dark and deceitful, round and round
some deep rock-brimmed basin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here and there, indeed, it spread out into wide shallow
rippling rapids, filling the whole bottom of the
ravine from side to side, but more generally it did not
occupy above a fourth part of the space below, leaving
sometimes on this margin, sometimes on that, broad
pebbly banks, or slaty ledges, affording an easy footing
and a clear path to the angler in its troubled
waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a rapid glance over the well-known scene,
Jasper plunged into the coppice, and following a faint
track worn by the feet of the wild-deer in the first
instance, and widened by his own bolder tread, soon
reached the bottom of the chasm, though not until he
had flushed from the dense oak covert two noble black
cocks with their superb forked tails, and glossy purple-lustered
plumage, which soared away, crowing their
bold defiance, over the heathery moorlands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once at the water’s edge, the young man’s tackle
was speedily made ready, and in a few minutes his
long line went whistling through the air, as he wielded
the powerful two-handed rod, as easily as if it had
been a stripling’s reed, and the large gaudy peacock-fly
alighted on the wheeling eddies, at the tail of a long
arrowy shoot, as gently as if it had settled from too
long a flight. Delicately, deftly, it was made to dance
and skim the clear, brown surface, until it had crossed
the pool and neared the hither bank; then again, obedient
to the pliant wrist, it arose on glittering wing,
circled half round the angler’s head, and was sent
thirty yards aloof, straight as a wild bee’s flight, into a
little mimic whirlpool, scarce larger than the hat of the
skillful fisherman, which spun round and round just to
leeward of a gray ledge of limestone. Scarce had it
reached its mark before the water broke all around
it, and the gay deceit vanished, the heavy swirl of the
surface, as the break was closing, indicating the great
size of the fish which had risen. Just as the swirl
was subsiding, and the forked tail of the monarch of
the stream was half seen as he descended, that indescribable
but well-known turn of the angler’s wrist,
fixed the barbed hook, and taught the scaly victim the
nature of the prey he had gorged so heedlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a wild bound he threw himself three feet out
of the water, showing his silver sides, with the sea-lice
yet clinging to his scales, a fresh sea-run fish of
fifteen, ay, eighteen pounds, and perhaps over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his broad back he strikes the water, but not as he
meant the tightened line; for as he leaped the practiced
hand had lowered the rod’s tip, that it fell in a loose
bight below him. Again! again! again! and yet a
fourth time he bounded into the air with desperate and
vigorous soubresaults, like an unbroken steed that
would dismount his rider, lashing the eddies of the
dark stream into bright bubbling streaks, and making
the heart of his captor beat high with anticipation of
the desperate struggle that should follow, before the
monster would lie panting and exhausted on the yellow
sand or moist greensward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Away! with the rush of an eagle through the air, he
is gone like an arrow down the rapids—how the reel
rings, and the line whistles from the swift working
wheel; he is too swift, too headstrong to be checked
as yet; tenfold the strength of that slender tackle might
not control him in his first fiery rush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jasper, although young in years, was old in the
art, and skillful as the craftiest of the gentle craftsmen.
He gives him the butt of his rod steadily, trying the
strength of his tackle with a delicate and gentle finger,
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
giving him line at every rush, yet firmly, cautiously,
feeling his mouth all the while, and moderating his
speed even while he yields to his fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, with the eye of intuition and the nerve
of iron, he bounds along the difficult shore, he leaps
from rock to rock, alighting on their slippery tops with
the firm agility of the rope-dancer, he splashes knee
deep through the slippery shallows, keeping his line
ever taut, inclining his rod over his shoulder, bearing
on his fish ever with a killing pull, steering him clear
of every rock or stump against which he would fain
smash the tackle, and landing him at length in a fine
open roomy pool, at the foot of a long stretch of white
and foamy rapids, down which he has just piloted
him with the eye of faith, and the foot of instinct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the great salmon has turned sulky; like
a piece of lead he has sunk to the bottom of the deep
black pool, and lies on the gravel bottom in the sullenness
of despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jasper stooped, gathered up in his left hand a heavy
pebble, and pitched it into the pool, as nearly as he
could guess to the whereabout of his game—another—and
another! Aha! that last has roused him. Again
he throws himself clear out of water, and again foiled
in his attempt to smash the tackle, dashes away down
stream impetuous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his strength is departing—the vigor of his rush
is broken. The angler gives him the butt abundantly,
strains on him with a heavier pull, yet ever yields a
little as he exerts his failing powers; see, his broad,
silver side has thrice turned up, even to the surface,
and though each time he has recovered himself, each
time it has been with a heavier and more sickly
motion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brave fellow! his last race is run, his last spring
sprung—no more shall he disport himself in the bright
reaches of the Tamar; no more shall the Naiads wreathe
his clear silver scales with river-greens and flowery
rushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cruel gaff is in his side—his cold blood stains
the eddies for a moment—he flaps out his death-pang
on the hard limestone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who-whoop! a nineteen pounder!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime the morning had worn onward, and ere
the great fish was brought to the basket the sun had
soared clear above the mist-wreaths, and had risen so
high into the summer heaven that his slant rays poured
down into the gorge of the stream, and lighted up the
clear depths with a lustre so transparent that every
pebble at the bottom might have been discerned, with
the large fish here and there floating mid depth, with
their heads up stream, their gills working with a quick
motion, and their broad tails vibrating at short intervals
slowly but powerfully, as they lay motionless in opposition
to the very strongest of the swift current.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The breeze had died away, there was no curl upon
the water, and the heat was oppressive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under such circumstances to whip the stream was
little better than mere loss of time, yet as he hurried
with a fleet foot down the gorge, perhaps with some
ulterior object, beyond the mere love of sport, Jasper
at times cast his fly across the stream, and drew it
neatly, and, as he thought, irresistibly right over the
recusant fish; but though once or twice a large lazy
salmon would sail up slowly from the depths, and
almost touch the fly with his nose, he either sunk down
slowly in disgust, without breaking the water, or flapped
his broad tail over the shining fraud as if to mark his
contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had now got to be near noon, for in the ardor of
his success the angler had forgotten all about his intended
breakfast; and, his first fish captured, had contented
himself with a slender meal furnished from out
his fishing-basket and his leathern bottle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jasper had traversed by this time some ten miles in
length, following the sinuosities of the stream, and had
reached a favorite pool at the head of a long, straight,
narrow trench, cut by the waters themselves in the
course of time, through the hard shistous rock which
walls the torrent on each hand, not leaving the slightest
ledge or margin between the rapids and the precipice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through this wild gorge of some fifty yards in length,
the river shoots like an arrow over a steep inclined
plane of limestone rock, the surface of which is polished
by the action of the water, till it is as slippery as ice,
and at the extremity leaps down a sheer descent of some
twelve feet into a large, wide basin, surrounded by
softly swelling banks of greensward, and a fair amphitheatre
of woodland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the upper end this pool is so deep as to be vulgarly
deemed unfathomable; below, however, it expands
yet wider into a shallow rippling ford, where it
is crossed by the high-road, down stream of which
again there is another long, sharp rapid, and another
fall, over the last steps of the hills; after which the
nature of the stream becomes changed, and it murmurs
gently onward through a green pastoral country unrippled
and uninterrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just in the inner angle of the high road, on the right
hand of the stream, there stood an old-fashioned, low-browed,
thatch-covered, stone cottage, with a rude
portico of rustic woodwork overrun with jassmine and
virgin-bower, and a pretty flower-garden sloping down
in successive terraces to the edge of the basin. Beside
this, there was no other house in sight, unless it were
part of the roof of a mill which stood in the low ground
on the brink of the second fall, surrounded with a mass
of willows. But the tall steeple of a country church
raising itself heavenward above the brow of the hill,
seemed to show that, although concealed by the undulations
of the ground, a village was hard at hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning had changed a second time, a hazy
film had crept up to the zenith, and the sun was now
covered with a pale golden veil, and a slight current
of air down the gorge ruffled the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a capital pool, famous for being the temporary
haunt of the very finest fish, which were wont to lie
there awhile, as if to recruit themselves after the exertions
of leaping the two falls and stemming the double
rapid, before attempting to ascend the stream farther.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Few, however, even of the best and boldest fishermen
cared to wet a line in its waters, in consequence
of the supposed impossibility of following a heavy fish
through the gorge below or checking him at the brink
of the fall. It is true, that throughout the length of the
pass, the current was broken by bare, slippery rocks
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
peering above the waters, at intervals, which might be
cleared by an active cragsman; and it had been in fact
reconnoitered by Jasper and others in cool blood, but
the result of the examination was that it was deemed
impassable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thinking, however, little of striking a large fish, and
perhaps desiring to waste a little time before scaling
the banks and emerging on the high road, Jasper threw
a favorite fly of peacock’s back and gold tinsel lightly
across the water; and, almost before he had time to
think, had hooked a monstrous fish, which, at the very
first leap, he set down as weighing at least thirty pounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereupon followed a splendid display of piscatory
skill. Well knowing that his fish must be lost if he
once should succeed in getting his head down the rapid,
Jasper exerted every nerve, and exhausted every art
to humor, to meet, to restrain, to check him. Four
times the fish rushed for the pass, and four times Jasper
met him so stoutly with the butt, trying his tackle
to the very utmost, that he succeeded in forcing him
from the perilous spot. Round and round the pool he
had piloted him, and had taken post at length, hoping
that the worst was already over, close to the opening
of the rocky chasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now perhaps waxing too confident he checked
his fish too sharply. Stung into fury, the monster
sprang five times in succession into the air, lashing the
water with his angry tail, and then rushed like an
arrow down the chasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was gone—but Jasper’s blood was up, and thinking
of nothing but his sport, he dashed forward and
embarked with a fearless foot in the terrible descent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leap after leap he took with beautiful precision,
alighting firm and erect on the centre of each slippery
block, and bounding thence to the next with unerring
instinct, guiding his fish the while with consummate
skill through the intricacies of the pass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were now but three more leaps to be taken
before he would reach the flat table-rock above the
fall, which once attained, he would have firm foot-hold
and a fair field; already he rejoiced, triumphant in the
success of his bold attainment, and confident in victory,
when a shrill female shriek reached his ears from the
pretty flower-garden; caught by the sound he diverted
his eyes, just as he leaped, toward the place whence
it came; his foot slipped, and the next instant he was
flat on his back in the swift stream, where it shot the
most furiously over the glassy rock. He struggled
manfully, but in vain. The smooth, slippery surface
afforded no purchase to his <a id='grip'></a>gripping fingers, no hold to his
laboring feet. One fearful, agonizing conflict with the
wild waters, and he was swept helplessly over the
edge of the fall, his head, as he glanced down foot
foremost, striking the rocky brink with fearful violence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was plunged into the deep pool, and whirled
round and round by the dark eddies long before he rose,
but still, though stunned and half disabled, he strove
terribly to support himself, but it was all in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he sunk and rose once more, and as he rose
that wild shriek again reached his ears, and his last
glance fell upon a female form wringing her hands in
despair on the bank, and a young man rushing down
in wild haste from the cottage on the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt that aid was at hand, and struck out again
for life—for dear life!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the water seemed to fail beneath him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A slight flash sprang across his eyes, his brain reeled,
and all was blackness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sunk to the bottom, spurned it with his feet, and
rose once more, but not to the surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His quivering blue hands emerged alone above the
relentless waters, grasped for a little moment at empty
space, and then disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The circling ripples closed over him, and subsided
into stillness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt, knew, suffered nothing more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His young, warm heart was cold and lifeless—his
soul had lost its consciousness—the vital spark had
faded into darkness—perhaps was quenched for ever.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>PART I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A gentle breeze swept through the vine-latticed
casement of a small apartment, filling it with all the
balmy odors of a June evening, while the moonbeams
stealing softly on its track, broke through the leafy
screen in fitful shadows. The sighing of the wind
through the long, slender branches of the willows—the
plaintive cry of the whip-poor-will, and at a little distance
the murmuring sound of water, as the waves of
the lake broke gently upon the shore—all were in
unison with the sad hearts of the two—a youth and
maiden, who, in that little room bathed by the moonbeams
and the breeze, were now about to be parted,
perhaps forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deep anguish was depicted on the countenance of
the young man—calm resolve and pious resignation on
that of his companion, who, with her hands clasped
before her, and her deep mournful eyes fixed tenderly
upon his, said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Richard, it cannot be—urge me no more to a
course which seems to me both cruel and unnatural.
Think you this sacrifice is not as painful to me as to
you, dear Richard?” she added, taking his hand and
pressing it to her lips, while a tear trickled slowly
down her pale cheek; “then reproach me not—call
me not heartless, unfeeling; rather encourage me to
fulfill faithfully the part which duty allots me—will you
not, Richard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And thus destroy my own happiness and yours,
Margaret! It is, indeed, a cruel task you would impose
on me. No—I cannot make our future life so
desolate as to sanction your cruel decision. Believe
me, dearest, your resolution is but the delirium of a
moment—grief for the loss of your beloved mother, and
sympathy with your afflicted father renders you morbidly
sensitive on that point alone. I entreat you, then,
dearest, beloved Margaret—I entreat you by all our
hopes of happiness, revoke your cruel words, and reflect
longer ere you consign us both to misery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have well deliberated, Richard, and my decision
is unalterable. Call it not delirium, or the shadow of
a grief which a moment’s sunshine may dispel; every
hour, on the contrary, will but strengthen my resolution,
and convince me I have acted rightly. My poor
father—can I leave him in his sad bereavement! who
else has he now to love but me—and shall I selfishly
turn from him in his loneliness! Ah, Richard, ask me
not—for never, never will I leave him or forsake him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And have you, then, no care for my wretchedness?”
exclaimed her lover with bitterness, as he
rapidly paced the floor; “no sympathy for my disappointment!
Think, Margaret, how long I have waited
to call you mine—how many years I have cheerfully
toiled, looking to this dear hand as my reward. O,
Margaret, Margaret!—and now, even now, when that
joyful hour was so near—when but a few days more
would have made you mine forever—it is you who
speak those bitter words—it is you who place a barrier
between our loves!—cruel, cruel girl!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the hand of Death, not mine, which has placed
the barrier between us, Richard—she who would have
blessed our union is no more! ‘<span class='it'>Forsake not your
father, my child!</span>’ were her dying words—and so
long as God gives me breath, I never will! Come
here, Richard, listen to me, and pity me—for not a pang
rends your bosom but finds an answering pang in mine;
nor do I hesitate to confess it to you in this sad moment—there
shall be no concealment from you—I will
not wrap my heart in maidenly reserve, but confess
alike my tenderness and my grief. No longer, then,
dearest Richard, accuse me of coldly sacrificing your
love to filial duty—for God knows the agony with
which I have decided.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, my beloved.” said Richard, “I have
been too selfish. I should have known that pure heart
better. However my own feelings may dictate, Margaret,
I will no longer oppose the course to which the
most devoted filial piety leads you, in thus unselfishly
renouncing love and happiness that you may devote
your days to a beloved parent. God bless and reward
you, dearest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Richard, how much your words comfort me,” replied
Margaret; “you no longer oppose but encourage
me. Thank you, dear Richard; yet one thing more,
when you leave me, you must be free from all engagement—nay,
do not interrupt me—many long years
may intervene ere I shall be free to give you my hand;
nor would I have its disposal linked with such a
dreadful alternative as my father’s death. The few
charms I may possess will ere long have faded, and I
would not bind you to me when the light of youth has
passed from cheek and eye. No, Richard—go forth
into the world, it claims your talents and your usefulness,
and in time some other will be to you all that I
would have been.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Margaret, you do not know me,” he replied.
“Think you another can ever come between me and
your image. I go, but the memory of our love shall
go with me—your name shall be my star, and for your
dear sake I will devote all my energies henceforth to
the happiness of my fellow-beings; your noble example
shall not pass without its lesson. But promise
me one thing, Margaret—let there be one solace for
my wretchedness—one hope, though faint, to cheer
my lonely path—promise me that should any thing
hereafter occur, no matter how long the flight of years,
which may induce you to wave your present decision,
you will write to me—will you—will you promise me
this, my best beloved?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Margaret placed her hand in his: “Yes, Richard, I
promise you—should that time come you shall be informed;
and I ask in return this, if your feelings have
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
meanwhile changed, if through time and absence I may
have become indifferent to you, Richard, then make no
reply to my communication—let there be forever
<span class='it'>silence</span>—or <span class='it'>joy</span>—between us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus parted two fond devoted hearts—a noble
sacrifice to filial love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never, perhaps, was there a more striking illustration
of the frail basis on which all human hopes are
placed, than was presented by those sudden events
overwhelming the inmates of Willow Bank Cottage
with affliction. Thus our most ardent expectations are
frequently met by disappointment, and our most promising
joys blighted. Even when happiness and peace
irradiate our hearts, and on the buoyant wing of hope
our fancy soars into a future of unclouded bliss, even
then desolation and wo may be at our very threshold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it proved with those whose history I will
briefly relate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Willow Bank, for many years the residence of the
Gardner family, was delightfully situated near the
borders of a lovely little lake, whose circling waters
rippled gently to the shore beneath the deep shadows
of the maple and sycamore—occasionally weeping
willows swept with their long golden pendants the
bright water, or the branches of some stately pine in
green old age, rose proudly above the lowly alder and
silvery birch here and there skirting the bank. Thus
rocked in its cradle of green, lay this beautiful little
lake, as blue as the blue sky above it were its waters,
now dimpled by the passing breeze, now breaking in
tiny wavelets, each with its cap of pearly foam, sportively
chasing each other like a band of merry children
to lose themselves at the feet of the brave old trees.
From the windows of the cottage the lake was seen
spreading itself out like some broad and beautiful mirror,
and then gently diverging into a narrow rivulet, winding
through meadow and woodland, until it sprang
joyously into the bosom of the Ohio. Nature had done
much to beautify the spot Mr. Gardner had selected
for his residence—taste and art had also united their
skill; the three combined had created almost a Paradise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is to those who dwelt therein, not to its local
beauties, my pen must confine itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early in life Mr. Gardner had married a lovely and
amiable woman, and removed from Virginia, his native
state, to the beautiful residence I have described,
a few miles from the town of S⁠—⁠—, Ohio. Blending
his profession of the law with that of agriculture, a
few years saw him one of the most influential men in
the country; and had he offered himself as a candidate
for office, he would have been almost certain of success,
such was his popularity; but his ambition took
not that course. Domestic happiness was to him worth
more than all the perishable honors of public life—to
Willow Bank and its beloved inmates were all his
wishes centred; and uninterrupted and continued for
many years were the smiles of Providence. It seemed,
indeed, as if this favored spot was exempt from all the
ordinary ills of life—sickness came not to fright the
roses from the cheek of health, neither did strife, envy,
or sullen discontent intrude upon this earthly paradise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. and Mrs. Gardner had but one child—it was
Margaret. When about seventeen, chance led to an
acquaintance with Richard Lelland, employed by an
eminent firm at the South upon business connected with
the sale of lands in Ohio. Among other letters of introduction
he brought one to Mr. Gardner, who, favorably
impressed with his appearance, invited him to
pass a few days at Willow Bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon what slight chances does our happiness or
misery rest. <span class='it'>A few days</span>—how simple their signification;
and yet from their brief circle how many
hours of bitter anguish may take their rise. Little did
Lelland or Margaret dream of the untold future, whose
all of earthly weal or wo these few days decided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To know Margaret was to love her—yet she was
not strictly beautiful; there may be features more
regular, complexions more dazzling, and forms of more
perfect symmetry than she possessed. She was one
of those whose gentle and winning manners stole into
your heart, and then only you saw her loveliness, or
acknowledged the light of love and tenderness which
beamed from her large, dark hazel eyes. Her beauty
was not that which attracts the eye of every careless
observer—it was the beauty of the mind and heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Richard Lelland was at that time twenty-one, rather
above the ordinary height, and of graceful, polished
manners, with a frank and open countenance, at once
a passport to your favor and respect. His complexion
was almost as delicate as a girl’s, a large, full, dark-blue
eye, and hair of rich wavy brown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Business detaining young Lelland in the vicinity of
Willow Bank for some weeks longer than he had first
anticipated, he took frequent opportunities of improving
his acquaintance with Miss Gardner, and the interest
she had first awakened in his heart soon ripened into
a deep and fervent attachment. But he possessed a
firmness and decision of character seldom met with in
one so young; and he resolved to bury his love for
Margaret in his own breast, until he could produce
such testimonials as to family, etc., as should warrant
his openly paying her his addresses. He therefore returned
to the South leaving his love unspoken; but
there is a language more eloquent even than words,
and this had already made known to Margaret the
sentiments of the young stranger; this, too, had whispered
in the lover’s ear, thrilling his soul with ecstasy,
that when he should ask the love of the pure and gentle
girl, it would be his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within the year the lovers were betrothed, with the
full sanction of Margaret’s parents, with the proviso
that their marriage should not be consummated until
Lelland, who had now nothing but his salary to depend
upon, should be in a situation better calculated for the
maintenance of a family. This was as much his wish
as theirs, for he loved Margaret too well to take her
from all the comforts and luxuries of the paternal roof,
only to offer in exchange the embarrassments and privations
attendant upon a narrow and straitened income.
For three years, therefore, early and late did he cheerfully
give all his energies to his business, and at the
end of that time became a partner in the mercantile
house in whose employ he had so faithfully exerted
himself. There was no longer, as it would seem, any
impediment to his union with his adored Margaret.
The wedding-day was appointed, and the happy Lelland,
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
with all the rapture of a bridegroom, flew to
claim his bride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had the hand of misfortune been so long withheld
but to crush with one fell blow so much of love and
happiness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very evening of his arrival at Willow Bank,
Mrs. Gardner was seized with a sudden and violent
illness, which, alas! baffled all medical skill, and in
less than twenty-four hours the beloved and idolized
wife and mother was no more. To depict the anguish
of the bereaved husband and daughter were a vain
attempt. To those in whose dwellings the destroyer
has never come, who have never read that fatal
sentence, “<span class='it'>Thou art mine!</span>” imprinted by his icy
fingers on the brow of the loved and cherished, or
followed to the dark and silent chambers the lifeless
forms of earth’s treasured ones, to them death is, indeed,
a fearful thing. To <span class='it'>them</span>—yes, to all; and did not our
Heavenly Father graciously extend to us the hand of
mercy, and bid us, with smiles of ineffable love, turn
to him for consolation in this hour of despair, how
could we sustain the anguish of separation, as one after
another the loved ones go home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Margaret the death of her mother at once opened
a new path of duty, and however painful the sacrifice
to herself, she hesitated not a moment as to the course
she should pursue. But when she thought of Lelland—of
the anguish her decision would cause him—of the
bitter disappointment—of fond hopes all blasted—then,
indeed, she faltered, and her heart shrunk from inflicting
a blow so terrible. And again as she thought of
her unhappy father, her resolution strengthened. Could
she leave him; no! better sacrifice love, happiness, and
with them perhaps life itself, than forsake him in his
desolateness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stupefied as it were with amazement and grief,
Lelland listened at first in silence to the cruel words
of his beloved Margaret—then remonstrated—entreated—all
in vain. Reproaches were alike unavailing to
alter her decision, until touched at length by her grief,
and filled with admiration of her self-sacrificing devotion
to her parent, with an almost breaking heart he
yielded to her persuasions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A new character must now be introduced. Henry
Wingate was an orphan nephew of Mr. Gardner, and
since the death of his parents, which took place when
he was quite young, Willow Bank had been his home.
As a boy he was artful and selfish, passionate and
cruel. As he grew up to manhood he still retained the
same foibles, with the double art of veiling them under
the most specious and insinuating address. If he loved
any one when a child, it was his Cousin Margaret—she
only had power to quell his wild storms of passion.
With years this love (if it be not profanation to call it
so) increased, until it took possession of his whole
being—yet, characteristic of himself, it was purely
selfish; so that he could make her his, it little mattered
to him whether his love was returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That he should hate Lelland followed of course, and
that his soul should be filled with jealousy and rage, as
he saw the time so rapidly drawing near when another
should snatch from him the charms he so much coveted.
The sudden death of her who had ever been as a kind
and tender mother to him, gave him therefore but a
momentary pang. Her grave only opened to him new
hopes, new machinations, and with such joy as filled
the Tempter at the destruction of Eden, did his heart
leap at the wretchedness of his hated rival, thus doomed
to see his long cherished hopes all blasted, and to part,
perhaps forever, with her he so devotedly loved.
And now all his sophistry and cunning were brought
to bear. Carefully concealing his own fiendish joy
under the mask of deep sympathy and sorrow, he
breathed only to Margaret words of tender pity—stabbing
his own ears by dwelling upon the virtues of
Lelland, and assuring her that his own life would be a
cheerful sacrifice if thereby he might advance her
happiness. Thus artfully did he begin his course,
trusting in time to supplant his rival in her affections.
But he little understood the heart of a faithful woman,
or he would not have undertaken a task so hopeless.
Margaret was grateful for his kindness, and it was a
relief to unburthen her heart to one who seemed so
truly to sympathize with her; nor did she hesitate to
speak of Lelland, or conceal from her cousin the sorrows
which sometimes oppressed her when reflecting
upon their reparation. Like hot molten lead did her
every word seethe and scorch his jealous soul, yet resolved
to win her, he persevered in the artful course
he had marked out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus passed two long weary years to Margaret,
sustained by the consciousness that she was administering
to the happiness of her father, and by that Higher
Power to whose never-failing support affliction had
taught her to look. But now another trial even more
severe awaited her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah, poor return for such filial love and piety. A
thankless boon, young Margaret, did you offer, when
for a father’s happiness you so devotedly sacrificed
your own! A sacrifice, however, not the less to be
admired—for where is the heart that does not reverence
such a beautiful trait of filial love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Gardner suddenly announced to Margaret his
intention of marriage with a young, thoughtless girl of
rather doubtful reputation, who had been occasionally
employed to assist in the work of the family. A cruel
stroke was this, to which all that had gone before
seemed light in comparison. What though it released
her from all obligation of duty; what though she was
now free to accept the hand of Lelland, the thought
gave her no satisfaction—not a ray of happiness gleamed
from out the darkness of her despair. To have retained
her dear father <span class='it'>her own</span>; to feel that in her all
his happiness was still treasured, she would have
deemed almost any sacrifice too poor; or had he been
about to unite himself with one more worthy to fill the
place of her sainted mother, she would have schooled
herself to resignation. But that her father should have
selected for a wife one so unsuited by birth and education,
and of a character so vain and frivolous, filled her
with dread for the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a strange hallucination of Mr. Gardner.
There is no way of accounting for a procedure so at
variance with the whole tenor of his former life, and
it can only be regarded in the light of insanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Margaret shrunk not from the task to which duty
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
impelled her, namely, to remonstrate and warn her
father against the step he was taking. The winds
which hurled the dead leaves of autumn in fitful
showers against the window, as she thus tearfully besought
his consideration and forbearance, would have
yielded to her voice as soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Passing over the further grief of Margaret, I will
only say that in a few weeks this ill-assorted marriage
took place, and a system of petty tyranny and malice
commenced on the part of the new Mrs. Gardner as
almost broke her heart. Captive to the arts of an
intriguing woman, her father heeded neither her tears
or her complaints, until at length Margaret finding all
remonstrance vain, passively yielded herself to the
cruel yoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus repulsed as it were from the affections of her
father, all her domestic happiness destroyed, and subjected
more and more to the insults of a low, vulgar-minded
woman, it would seem the time had come
when Margaret might redeem the promise made to
Lelland, that should any thing occur which might induce
her to waive her decision, she would write to him.
A doubt of his constancy had never darkened her mind;
she judged of him by her own true heart, which never
could know change. If at first she hesitated, it was
from maidenly timidity, not distrust; but when she
reflected what happiness those few brief lines would
cause him, she hesitated no longer. The letter was
written. To her cousin, the specious Wingate, she
frankly confided her resolution, and asked his assistance
in forwarding her letter safely and surely to the
hands of Lelland. Skillfully as he wore the mask, he
was almost betrayed as he listened to the artless details
of Margaret, who faithfully related to him the promise
each had made at their last sad parting. Recovering
himself, however, he promised to secure the safety of
her letter, even if it should include the necessity of
journeying himself to place it in his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With thanks warm and sincere for his kindness and
sympathy, the deceived, trusting girl gave her letter to
his charge—that precious letter, which thus, like the
dove, went forth to seek rest for her weary soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! think you, my pretty cousin, I value my own
purposes so lightly as to risk the work of years within
the delicate folds of this envelope!” exclaimed Wingate,
as he entered his own apartment, and crushing
the letter of Margaret in his hand as he spoke. “I
should be a fool, indeed—no, no, fair lady, content you
that my eye alone may read this pretty sentimental
effusion. Now, thanks to my lucky stars, this letter
proves almost a sure passport to my desires—ha! ha!
pretty little fool, how she will wait for an answer!
And what then? Did she not entreat <span class='it'>silence if he no
longer loved</span>—‘let there be forever silence or joy between
us’—were her words—<span class='it'>silence</span>—ay, of that I
will take care, and then she is mine—mine as surely
as yonder setting sun will rise again! With your
leave, Mr. Richard Lelland—” and thus violating
every honorable principle, Wingate tore asunder the
seal of affection, and ran his eye over the sacred contents:
“D—n him!” he exclaimed, hurling the letter
across the table with a look almost demoniacal: “I
could tear his very heart out—his heart!—why here
it is—yes, fond fool, why here is his very life—his
soul!”—once more snatching the letter—“and thus I
hold him in my power!—if more were needed to spur
on my revenge of a hated, detested rival, I have it
here in these tender, trustful lines. By heavens it
turns my very blood to gall to find with what fidelity
that man has been loved—while I—but no matter—your
letter goes no further, fair cousin, and thus do I
annihilate your fond hopes and devote you mine!”
thrusting as he spoke poor Margaret’s epistle into the
flames, and watching it with a fiendish smile until of
those tender, confiding lines, nothing but a blackened
scroll remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the expiration of a week he informed her that he
had heard from the friend to whose care he had enclosed
her letter, stating that he had delivered it into
Lelland’s own hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor deceived girl! O the wretchedness of hope
deferred, as day after day flew by, and still no answer
came! It was only by her more pallid cheek, her
drooping eyelids, and the wan smile by which she
strove to hide her dejection, that Wingate saw his hellish
scheme was succeeding, and his victim sinking
under the belief of her lover’s inconstancy—for she
never again mentioned to him the name of Lelland.
Nothing could be kinder, or better calculated to touch
the heart of Margaret than the demeanor which her
cousin now assumed. His countenance wore a look
of such subdued pity—such heavy sighs would now
and then burst from his heart—and then meeting her
inquiring glance, he would turn from her, or perhaps
rush from the room, as if to conceal the tears her sorrows
called forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus another six months passed—bringing no change
for the better in the alienated affections of Mr. Gardner
for his child—they were all engrossed by the artful
woman he had so unhappily married. He did not, it
is true, treat her with visible unkindness, but with a
coldness and jealousy which stung the heart of Margaret
perhaps more deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wingate now resolved to delay no longer the avowal
of his <span class='it'>love</span>! And accordingly most adroitly opened
the subject to Margaret—he told her for how many
years he had loved her—of the silent grief which he
had so long endured under the conviction that her
affections were given to another—and how by many
bitter struggles he had schooled his heart to relinquish
her at last to a happy rival. He did not ask her love
in return, but the privilege to protect her! Her pity
and kindness were all he dared to hope for <span class='it'>now</span>—but
perhaps at a future time his long-tried devotion might
be rewarded with her affection—and for that he was
willing to wait—too happy if he might look for such a
priceless recompense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not doubting for a moment his sincerity, and touched
by his kindness, Margaret yielded to the tempter’s
wiles and became his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here we must leave her, allowing for the lapse
of some sixteen years ere we again take up the story.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>PART II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In the summer of 1840, a gentleman embarked at
Albany, on board one of those magnificent steamers
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
which ply between that city and New York. The
morning was one of unrivaled loveliness. A soft haze
curtained the landscape, veiling the shores and the
silvery outline of the river in one dim, undefined perspective
of beauty, through which the sun like a huge
ball of fire floated on the verge of the eastern sky. As
the morning wore on, a gentle breeze was seen curling
the smooth surface of the river, and then fold after fold
of the beautiful curtain was lifted from the landscape.
The silvery vapors circling, dividing, re-uniting, and
wreathing themselves into a thousand fantastic shapes,
floated lightly away, leaving the charming scenery of
the Hudson unveiled to the admiring eye of the
traveler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gentleman to whom allusion has been made,
was apparently near or over forty years of age, of a
most prepossessing exterior. He was tall, finely built,
and his countenance denoting benevolence and peace
with all men. A shade of sadness, however, evidently
of no recent origin, was stamped upon his fine features,
involuntarily claiming your sympathy and respect.
Such was the person who now slowly paced the deck—now
stopping to admire some beautiful point of
scenery, now communing with his own thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boat was crowded with passengers, presenting
the usual variety composing the “world” of a steamboat.
But with these the stranger held no communion—not
a familiar face met his in all that motley assemblage.
It was already near the dinner hour, and many
of the passengers had descended to the dining-saloon,
or gathered around the companion-way waiting the
deafening stroke of the gong, when his attention was
suddenly drawn to a little group seated under the awning
aft of the ladies’ cabin. Reclining on cushions
spread over one of the settees was a lady whose hollow,
racking cough betokened the last stages of consumption.
A large shawl carefully enveloped her
figure, and one pale, attenuated hand rested heavily
upon her bosom, as if to stay the rapid pulsation of her
heart caused by those violent paroxysms of coughing.
A thin veil was thrown lightly over her head, screening
her marble paleness. Two young girls, almost
children, sat by the couch—the eldest, whose profile
only could be seen as she sat with her back nearly
turned to the passengers, was gently fanning her mother,
and now and then moistening her fevered lips
with the grateful juice of an orange, or when seized
with coughing, tenderly supporting her head, and
wiping the perspiration from her throbbing temples.
The younger, a sweet little child of perhaps ten years,
had thrown off her bonnet, and thick masses of rich
brown ringlets fell over her neck and shoulders. She
was seated on a low ottoman by the side of the settee,
reading from a small Bible which she held in her hand—pausing
whenever the terrible cough racked the poor
invalid, and then stooping over her would kiss her pale
lips, and the little white hand, and again in sweet low
tones resume her book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger found himself deeply interested in this
little group—it was in harmony with his own melancholy
thoughts, and stirred the deep waters of kindness
in his soul. Mechanically he stopped in his walk,
and leaning over the rail continued to muse upon the
sick lady and the affectionate little girls, occasionally
resting his eyes upon the unconscious objects of his
meditation. When the deck was nearly deserted for
the dinner-table, the youngest of the two girls finding
her mother slept, softly rose and without putting on
her bonnet drew near the spot where the stranger was
still standing, and bent down her beautiful head over
the railing as if to peer into the depths of old Hudson.
At that moment one of the river gods (possibly) in the
shape of a large sturgeon, his scaly armor all flashing
in the bright sunbeams, leaped up some twelve or fifteen
feet above the surface. An exclamation of surprise
burst from the little girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, sir, what was that?” she asked, turning her
large black eyes upon the stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that sweet face, and those deep, earnest eyes,
sudden emotion thrilled his heart, and sent the blood
coursing rapidly through his veins. That face—it was
so like—so very like one with whose memory both
happiness and misery held divided sway! Scarcely
could he command himself to answer her artless question;
and after having done so, in an agitated voice he
asked⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you tell me your name, my dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child hesitated a moment, as if doubting the
propriety of giving her name to a stranger, but there
was something so kind and benevolent in his looks that
compelled her irresistibly to reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is Margaret—Margaret Wingate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Richard Lelland took her small slender hand, put
back the beautiful curls from her forehead, and gazed
long and mournfully into her face, then turning away
walked slowly to the opposite side of the deck and
soon disappeared. And the little girl, wondering at
his strange behaviour, returned to her seat by the side
of her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was more than an hour ere Lelland again made
his appearance. He was pale, and it seemed as if
an age of sorrow had in that brief hour swept over
his soul. Again he took his station near the little
group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the mean time the sick lady had remained quiet,
and the sisters still retained their position by her side.
Margaret soon raising her eyes met those of the
stranger, who smilingly beckoned her to approach.
Rising very softly, the child glided to his side, and
placed her little hand confidingly in his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you ask your sister to come to me, my dear,
I would speak with her a moment?” said Lelland,
laying his hand tenderly on her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Margaret returned to her sister, who, in a few moments,
timid and blushing, drew near. She seemed
about fourteen, of a slight, graceful figure, and with
the same expression of countenance, only more
thoughtful, as her younger sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will excuse the presumption of a stranger,
young lady,” said Lelland, “but unless I greatly err, I
see before me the daughter of a much loved friend.
Tell me, was not your mother’s maiden name Margaret
Gardner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, that was her name,” she replied in evident
surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew I could not be mistaken,” continued Lelland,
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
sighing deeply—then after a pause—“and your—your
father—is he with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is not—but will meet us on our arrival in New
York.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has your mother been long ill?” inquired Lelland,
his voice faltering as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has been declining for several years,” replied
the young girl, “but for the last six months her strength
has rapidly failed. O, my dear sir,” she added, bursting
into tears, “if she should die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lelland could not answer—at length he resumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And are you then traveling alone, my dear young
lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We came as far as Albany under the protection of
a neighbor, and the captain of the boat has promised to
take charge of us to the city.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I do any thing to aid you? Is there not something
you would like to have for your mother? if so,
consider me in the light of an old acquaintance, and
frankly tell me. My name is Lelland, Richard Lelland—I
knew your dear mother when she was but a few
years older than yourself;” he paused, and overcome
with emotion turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary took his hand. “I have often heard her mention
you. O let me tell her at once that such an old
and valued friend is near—she will be so glad to see
you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my dear girl, not now—the surprise might
prove too much for her in her present weak state—but
allow me to be near you, and call upon me if need
require.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary thanked him, and then resumed her faithful
care of her mother, who was now apparently in an
easy slumber; and walking lightly around the settee,
Lelland took a seat near the head of the invalid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who can describe the anguish of his soul as he thus
watched over the dying form of his first and only love.
And yet, with its bitterness was mingled a strange
feeling of happiness, and his heart rose in thankfulness
to be near her—even in death!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day was now nearly spent, and the boat shooting
rapidly past the beautiful Palisades, when Mrs.
Wingate awoke, and complaining of a slight chilliness
proposed retiring to the cabin. With difficulty she
arose and leaning on the arm of Mary attempted to
walk, but she was so feeble she could scarcely stand,
and the slender strength of Mary seemed all too frail a
support. Lelland immediately advanced, and, averting
his face, proffered his assistance. Thanking him for
his kindness, Mrs. Wingate placed her arm in his, and
carefully supporting her to the cabin, and placing her
in an easy commodious seat, he left her to the care of
her children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah, little did the poor invalid dream whose arm had
so tenderly sustained her feeble steps!</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the boat was nearing the wharf, Mary came
out of the cabin and joined Lelland, who was standing
close by the door, and taking his arm crossed over to
the side, that she might recognize, and be recognized
at once by her father, whom she was expecting every
moment to appear among the crowd collected on the
wharf. Once or twice she thought she saw him, but
it proved not. The boat stopped at length, and the
passengers group after group dispersed, until scarcely
any one was left on board save the officers of the boat.
Still Mr. Wingate did not appear, and overcome by
disappointment and their lonely situation, poor Mary
burst into tears. Lelland strove to comfort her, and
having ascertained from her the hotel where her father
lodged, he offered to go himself in search of him.
Bidding her return to her mother, and calm any uneasiness
she might feel at the nonappearance of her
husband, he left the boat and proceeded to the hotel.
Mr. Wingate was not there. He had been gone some
days, nor could they give any information respecting
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was to be done?—something must be decided
upon at once. It was getting late—already the street
lamps were lighted—and hastily retracing his steps to
the steamboat, Lelland sent for Mary. She turned
pale when she saw he was alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father—where is my father?” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt, my dear, your father has been called
away unexpectedly—you will see him I am sure to-morrow.
In the mean time don’t be uneasy—you
are with one who will not desert you for a moment—but
lest your mother may hesitate to entrust herself to
the protection of an apparent stranger, I think it will
be necessary for me to reveal myself to her.” Taking
a card from his pocket he wrote a few lines upon it,
and handed them to Mary, who quickly glided back
into the cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lelland now strove to calm his agitation, that he
might meet his still beloved Margaret with firmness—without
betraying more than the pleasure one naturally
feels at meeting with an old friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was half an hour ere Mary again appeared, and
informed him her mother would be pleased to see
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He entered the cabin. The light of an argand lamp
fell gently upon the pale countenance of Mrs. Wingate,
who was partially reclining upon one of the settees,
with her head resting against the crimson silken
panels. She had thrown off her little cap, on account
of the heat, and her jet-black hair was swept back from
her brow by the slender little hand which pressed her
temples. Little Margaret was kneeling at her feet,
and looking up into her face with an expression of
childish pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The step of Lelland faltered as he drew near—as
his eye fell upon that countenance so changed from its
youthful loveliness,—so pallid, so wan, and on which
it seemed Death had already stamped his seal—scarcely
could he command himself to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Margaret, you will trust yourself with me?” he
said at length, forcing a smile and extending his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A slight color for an instant suffused her pale cheek,
and her still beautiful eyes were lifted to his—she
attempted to speak, but could not, and placing her
thin, feverish hand in his, she burst into tears. For a
few moments no word was spoken. Mrs. Wingate
was the first to recover herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My nerves are very weak, as you see,” she said,
with a sad smile, pressing his hand, “and the sight of
an old friend quite overpowers me—but I am very
glad to see you, and thank you for your kindness.
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
Mr. Wingate must have been unexpectedly detained
from us, or—” she hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you will allow me, I trust, the pleasure of
attending upon you, and of procuring lodgings for you
until the arrival of your husband,” said Lelland.
“You must be very much fatigued—a carriage is in
waiting, and if you will allow me, I will soon place
you in a more comfortable situation—if you will point
out to me your trunks, Miss Mary, I will take care of
them.” And Lelland gladly left the cabin, that he
might school himself to more fortitude ere meeting the
poor invalid again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When all was ready, he tenderly lifted the frail form
of Mrs. Wingate and placed her in the carriage, Mary
and little Margaret sprang after, and then giving the
driver the necessary directions Lelland himself took a
seat therein. The carriage in a short time stopped before
one of the large private hotels in the upper part of
the city, where he was certain both quiet and comforts
of every kind might be obtained for the invalid.
They were conducted at once to a pleasant, retired
little parlor, opening into a commodious sleeping-room,
and after attending to all their immediate requirements
Lelland left them for the purpose of again seeking Mr.
Wingate; resolving to leave a note for him at the hotel
where he had boarded, and also to drop another into
the post-office. Meeting the maid-servant in the hall,
he put some money in her hand, and charged her to
be very attentive to the sick lady, promising her she
should be well rewarded for her kindness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon returning to the hotel early in the morning, he
was inexpressibly grieved to find that Mrs. Wingate
had passed a wretched night, and was now so ill that
it had been thought advisable to send for a physician.
Doctor M. soon arrived, and after visiting his patient,
returned to the saloon where Lelland was anxiously
awaiting him. His opinion was but a sad confirmation
of his worst fears—he pronounced Mrs. Wingate in
the last stage of decline, and that in all probability a
few days or weeks at furthest must close her life.
“Was there nothing could be done to save her?”
Lelland asked—nothing—she was past all human aid;
and now all there was left to do, was to smooth her
passage to the grave by kind and tender care. The
doctor promised to see her every day, and expressing
much sympathy for the little girls took his leave. That
day Lelland did not see Mrs. Wingate, yet he heard
her low stifled moans, and occasionally the faint tones
of her voice, for he had taken an apartment adjoining
hers, that he might be near in case his services were
required. Once or twice during the day and evening
he passed out the hotel, and jumping into a cab, sought
the former lodgings of Wingate, in the faint hope of
meeting him, and then returned to his sad and lonely
watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some days Mrs. Wingate remained nearly the
same, during which time nothing was heard of her
husband. No doubt the agitation of mind this caused
her had a most injurious effect upon her, and probably
hastened her death. Finding herself growing weaker,
Lelland was at length admitted to her room; and from
that time until her death a portion of every day was
spent by him at her bedside. He calmed her apprehensions
when speaking of the strange absence of her
husband, and strove to remove those delicate scruples
which she entertained that herself and children were
so entirely dependent upon him, assuring her he
thanked God it was in his power to be of service to
her. He read to her from the sacred Scriptures, and
as much as her feeble strength would admit conversed
with her of that unrevealed future into which her soul
must so soon take its flight. Of her husband she never
spoke but in terms of kindness, nor by her words gave
him reason to suppose he was not the best of husbands
and fathers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Days passed on. Mr. Wingate did not come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the last sad hour was at hand. Upon going
into her room one morning, Lelland was shocked
at the alteration a few hours had made in her appearance.
Death was there. Not as a tyrant—not armed
with terrors to seize the shrinking soul—but as some
gentle messenger, clad in robes of peace and joy, sent
to bear her to the arms of her Father. Lelland was
at first too much overcome to speak, and walked to
the window to recover composure. In a faint voice
she called him to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Richard,” she said, pressing his hand, “there is
but one pang in death—it is that I must leave my poor
children unprotected.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearest friend, do not suffer that thought to disturb
your peace of mind,” he replied tenderly; “they
shall be mine; until their father’s return I will be a
parent to them, and if he come not, Margaret—still
they will be mine. I have wealth, and how freely it
shall be used for their advantage and happiness you
surely cannot doubt. My life has been a lonely one—they
will cheer its decline”—he paused as if irresolute
whether to proceed—“I waited long and in vain for
that letter, Margaret—it came not!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first allusion made to their former love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She feebly pressed the hand which held hers: “It
was written, Richard—there came no answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>was</span> written then—thank God for that!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cold shudder crept over the frame of Margaret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! I see it all,” she said. “Richard, we were
betrayed! but may God forgive him, as I do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no reply; but stooping down Lelland imprinted
a kiss upon her cold brow, and turning away,
the strong man wept as a little child!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more he approached the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give your children to me, Margaret; I swear to
you I will faithfully protect and cherish them. I shall
never marry, and my whole life shall be devoted to
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sweet smile illumined her features. “Yes, Richard,
they are yours. For my sake forgive their father,
and should he return, O, I beseech you, lend him your
counsel, and say to him all that I would say—” she
paused—“perhaps he will tear the children from you;
if so, at a distance watch over them, and protect them
when they require it. Now, my friend, call them to
me; I would say a few words to them, and I feel my
strength rapidly failing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary and Margaret remained with their mother near
an hour, and then Lelland was hastily summoned to
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
the chamber of the dying. She was already speechless,
but with a look of ineffable sweetness, she turned
her eyes first upon her children, then upon Lelland;
with her little strength she placed their hands within
his, her lips moved as if in prayer, celestial beauty
overspread her countenance, and the weary soul of
Margaret was at rest in the bosom of her God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after the last melancholy rites Lelland placed
the girls at school, under the care of a most excellent
woman whom he engaged to accompany them. Not
a day passed that he did not see them, and on Saturdays
he took them <a id='tookthem'></a>on pleasant excursions into the country,
as much as possible striving to divert their minds from
dwelling upon their recent loss. In the meanwhile he
took every measure he could possibly devise to discover
Mr. Wingate—but for many months in vain, his
disappearance was veiled in impenetrable mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was nearly a year after the death of Margaret,
that one day business took Mr. Lelland to one of the
slips on the North river. As he passed along, his attention
was suddenly drawn to a man who stood leaning
against one of the piers. He was very shabbily dressed,
and held in his hand a small faded well-worn carpetbag.
Giving no heed to the moving crowd around
him, buried in thought, he stood with his eyes fixed
vacantly on the river. There was something in his
features which seemed familiar. Turning, Mr. Lelland
again passed him, fixing his eyes intently upon him as
he did so, and more and more confirmed that his suspicions
were correct, he stepped up to him, and touching
him lightly on the shoulder, said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me—but is not your name Wingate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose it is—what the d——l is yours?” replied the
man sullenly, without turning his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is Lelland, Mr. Wingate—for such you
are, or I greatly err.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With an expression of malignant hate, the man suddenly
turned, and shook his fist almost in the very
teeth of Lelland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we have met again, Mr. Richard Lelland, have
we! Well, we shall see who will be the better for the
meeting, that’s all—d——n you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your words are idle,” replied Lelland, calmly.
“Answer me one question—do you know aught of your
wife and children!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the mention of his family, Wingate grew suddenly
pale, and seemed much agitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you—what—what do you know of them?”
he demanded, but in more subdued tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will go with me into the hotel yonder, I
may perhaps give you some information respecting
them,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without a word Wingate mechanically followed
Lelland, who, ordering a private room, sat down to
the melancholy duty before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You spoke of my wife and children,” exclaimed
Wingate, the moment they entered the room, “if you
know any thing of them, for God’s sake tell me, for it
is many months since I heard from them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prepare yourself for the most melancholy tidings,”
said Lelland, in a sympathizing voice and manner.
“You have no longer a wife—it is now ten months
since her death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wretched man buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead—dead—dead! and without forgiving me—<span class='it'>dead</span>!”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With her latest breath she forgave and blessed you,”
said Lelland, taking his hand kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my children—where are they—are they
dead, too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your children are here—here, in the city; you
may see them in an hour if you will,” replied Lelland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Here!</span> here in the city—here, with <span class='it'>you</span>!” cried
Wingate, starting up, every feature distorted by passion;
“with <span class='it'>you</span>, do you say! how came <span class='it'>you</span> near
<span class='it'>her</span> death-bed—ha! <span class='it'>did you dare</span>—” seizing Lelland
by the breast as he spoke. But shaking him off, Lelland
placed his hand on his arm, saying,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First listen to me, Mr. Wingate, and you will see
how little provocation you have for such anger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then briefly related his unexpected and providential
meeting with Margaret and her children, and
the painful scene which so soon followed it. He spoke
of Mary and Margaret—of their loveliness, their sweet
dispositions, and of the consolation and happiness
Wingate might yet receive from their affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had done speaking, the unhappy man seized
the hand of Lelland, and pressing it fervently, said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wretch—wretch that I am! how little have I
merited such goodness. It is, indeed, more than my
guilty soul can bear. I had rather you would stab me
to the heart than thus pierce my soul with deeds of
kindness—for I deserve it not. It was I, Lelland, who
robbed you of one of God’s choicest treasures. When
driven almost to despair by the unjust treatment of her
father, who should have been to her more than father
ever was, poor Margaret wrote you that letter which
would have confirmed your happiness and hers. It
was <span class='it'>I</span>, who, goaded on by hate for you, and a determination
to make her mine—it was I who destroyed
it! I watched the struggle of her pure heart; I saw
her cheek pale day by day, and yet I repented not—nay,
I gloried in my revenge. At length she became my
wife—and an angel she ever was to me, always so kind,
so patient with my follies; but I knew she loved you—I
knew her heart was silently breaking, her strength
wasting, and instead of moving my pity, it only drove
me to madness. I was jealous even of my sweet
babes, that they were loved more than me. For years
I ran a wild career of riot and debauchery, and only
came to my senses to see my poor injured wife was truly
dying; then came remorse—but it was too late. My
business had been neglected—my affairs were in ruin,
and I saw myself on the brink of poverty. The doctor
had said that change of air would do much toward
her restoration; and now, as anxious to restore as I
had been to destroy, I resolved to come to New York
and find some employment which should warrant my
removing my family here. I did so, and was so fortunate
as to obtain a situation as book-keeper, with a
handsome salary. In a few months I wrote my wife
and children to join me. I received for answer that
she was now too feeble to journey. This made me
angry, though why, God only knows, except that I
would not let her die among scenes your love had
hallowed—and I immediately wrote a peremptory
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
command for her to come, naming the day I should
expect her. In this wicked frame of mind I went out
into the streets, and, unfortunately meeting a gay companion,
was induced to enter a gambling-house, and
ere I left, every dollar I possessed in the world was
swept from me. In the vain hope of winning back
my money, I again sought that den of destruction;
need I say, so far from retrieving, I left it hundreds in
debt. Then, then, Richard Lelland, I became a <span class='it'>forger</span>—yes,
forged the name of my worthy employer—was
detected, and fled with my ill-got gains. The day I
had appointed my poor Margaret to arrive in the city
I was on the way to the West Indies. From thence I
went to Paris, where, as long as my money lasted I
led a mad career; that expended, I was forced to the
most menial offices to obtain my daily food. At last
driven by remorse, I determined to return to my native
country, see Margaret and my children once more,
and then give myself up to the laws I had outraged.
I flattered myself that my wife still lived, and that not
finding me in the city on her arrival, had gone back to
Ohio. I arrived last night, and was even now about
to take passage in a sloop for Albany, thinking I should
be less likely to meet any acquaintance, when you so
unexpectedly appeared before me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this dreadful recital Lelland had listened in
silence. When it was ended, he took the hand of
Wingate,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wretched man,” said he, “I forgive you for the
misery of a lifetime, as did that suffering angel, now in
heaven; and may God extend to you his peace and
mercy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then calling for pen, ink and paper, he drew a check
for the amount Wingate had forged, and placed it in
his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, Mr. Wingate, take that; in the morning
see your late employer, and restore him the money of
which you defrauded him; in the meantime I will see
what can be done for you—rely upon me as your
friend. But remain here for the night, and on no account
leave the room; have patience, for to-morrow
you shall see your children.” So saying, Lelland took
leave, promising to call for him in a carriage at an
early hour in the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately after breakfast, therefore, he proceeded
to the hotel. But Wingate had already left—had been
gone some hours. On the table was a letter directed
to Lelland. Hastily breaking the seal, he read:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Burthened with grief, and overwhelmed with remorse,
life is insupportable. I can no longer endure
the torments of self-reproach, and I fly to end alike my
wretchedness and my life. Heaven is dark—but earth
is hell! Protect my innocent children!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day the body of Henry Wingate was exposed
in the Dead-House. Lelland recognized and
claimed it for burial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary and Margaret were told their father was no
more—but of the manner of his wretched death they
never knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Facts have often the appearance of fiction—such is
the story I have given. If it has called forth any interest
in the minds of my readers, the assurance that its
principal incidents were gathered from real life, will
not, I trust, lessen that interest. Names and scene are,
of course, fictitious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a splendid mansion on the banks of the Potomac,
Mr. Lelland still resides with the two fair daughters
of his adoption. They are beautiful and accomplished,
beloved by all who know them, and most tenderly protected
and cherished by their more than father; while
those gems of early piety implanted in their minds by
their mother, have, under the careful culture of Mr.
Lelland, put forth the most lovely and Christian
graces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus in the happiness and the virtues of her children,
has God rewarded the filial piety of poor
Margaret.</p>

<div><h1><a id='therm'></a>THOUGHTS ON THE THERMOMETER.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Climate is said to have much influence on the physical,
moral, mental, political and social condition of
mankind. Experience and observation certainly give
force to such an opinion. The difference in manners,
customs and character of the Russ and the Italian is
as much owing to latitude as lineality. One’s happiness,
and even one’s destiny in life, depend alike on
Seasons and on Self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The iron constitution, the sharp wit, the keen sense,
the peculiar individuality, the guessing and bartering
of the man of Maine, contrasts with the singing, siesta-seeking,
music-loving, rich intellectuality of the Mexican
of the hacienda. Even in religious sentiment the
difference is striking. Look upon the cold, austere
meeting-house worship of the Puritan, and side by
side behold the rich, voluptuous cathedral service of
the Catholic. These at least indicate the extremes of
the influence of the climate. The whole physical,
mental and moral constitution of man is operated upon
by the temperature of his location, and thus affecting
not only his individual existence but the ultimate condition
of his race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What would have been the fate of “The Colonists”
of the “May-Flower” had they landed at San Francisco
or St. Domingo? If instead of the stern, bracing,
labor-requiring, excess-denying latitude of Plymouth,
the Pilgrims had rested in the land of the palmetto and
the pomegranate? Or who would have ventured on
an unknown ocean, in search for a new world, if the
hope, the imagination, the enthusiasm, the poetry, the
mental excitement, the superstition even of Columbus,
the child of the South, had sunk in despair, or yielded
to first disappointment? Where would the close calculation
of the North, founded on a philosophical hypothesis,
have sought for continued animation, after
error has resulted from experiment?</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
Where would the literature of the Past have found
admirers, and even devotees, if the mythology of the
East had not been nursed in the soft lap of a congenial
temperature?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why is it that the Latin classics yet hold a place as
familiar as household words, if a Southern sky had
not invited to the rich developments of the highest
mental creations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where could the painter and sculptor have sought
models and studies, if the winter of the Mediterranean
had been as relentless and as rigid as that of Moscow?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Can it be maintained that Solon and Lycurgus would
have alike given their fame in trust to immortality, if
the genial influences of the land of their nativity had
not been the same “at Rome as it was at Attica”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who will venture to assert that a similar fate would
have followed the siege of Troy in a land of snows,
or that Marathon would have been a northern Moscow?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Science, too, has felt the force of the benefit of its
more northern home. With a temperature unshocked
by extremes, the highest mental industry yields more,
or rather different, fruit than the richest intellectual
soil. The wheat and the corn of the necessaries to
progress, are gathered only where the wine and the
oil of luxury do not grow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Tyre and Sidon were marts for the cosmopolite,
and now are but the refuge for the wanderer,
while Boston, New York, New Orleans were the seaboards
of the savage, and are now the emporiums of a
hemisphere, is as true as that the causes are to be
found in some degree dependent upon the influences of
climate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Rome was the mother of nations, the terror of
thrones, and the great entrance into eternity, and now
is the dismantled wreck of her illustrious past—while
the hunting-grounds of the “Six Nations” are transformed
into a mighty empire, is but the melancholy
picture of the past, gorgeous in its dilapidation, under
the luxurious warmth of an Italian sky, while the other
is the picture of the present, more magnificent and
vigorous, tinted by the rays of a western sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Climate was not alone in producing these changes,
yet its influence was potent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Religion of Nazareth took its metaphors from
the land of Aristotle, its enthusiasm from the nations
on the “seacoast,” its energy from the Northmen, but
<span class='it'>its divinity from God</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The songs of labor are heard loudest and sweetest
where the valley and forest yield an annual tribute
over the grave of all that is beautiful, born of the
spring; while the songs of the sentiments take their
melodies from the land of soft sunlight, scented with
perennial perfumes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In considering the Future let us look at the Past,
and among the most remarkable of physical causes
which have marked their existence on the history of
nations and of men, climate will be found to have exercised
by no means an inconsiderable influence.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The March winds blew chillingly over a wide and
barren moor in the Highlands of Scotland, and howled
fiercely around the isolated dwelling in the middle of
it, from whence gleamed a faint light like a beacon
in the midst of that desolate waste. Black majestic
clouds gathered darker over head, and the wild
whistle of the coming tempest grew every moment
more shrill; but little were the boding sounds noted
within the cottage of Donald McLane, for sterner
and fiercer was the storm of sorrow gathering in the
human heart of the one lonely watcher, bending over
the low pallet where lay, in a still dreamless slumber,
the forerunner of one more dreamless yet, the
form of her only child. Long silken curls fell on the
white pillow, from the still whiter brow of the little
sufferer, and pearly lids, with long, dark fringes,
drooped over the fair cheek. The coverlet had been
cast aside, as by some restless motion, and the snow-white
drapery fell in careless folds, half-covering,
half-revealing those round and dimpled limbs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light from a solitary candle flickered over the
child’s face, so marble-like in its quiet beauty; oh!
there is a touching loveliness that waking life never
bestows in that death-like slumber which precedes
the parting hour of a young, sinless spirit! Angels
waited to bear it upward, and the shining light from
their own immortal faces, was reflected upon the
form of clay it was so soon to leave. Close beside
the couch, with clasped hands and a fixed gaze, motionless
as the object of her solicitude, knelt the young
mother—so very young and so fair; surely it was
early for such sorrow to weigh down her happy
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dull moments wore away, and still those two
pale faces gleamed in the half-darkness, silent and
still. The embers on the hearth burned low, louder
howled the tempest without, and the white snow-flakes
dashed against the window with a startling
sound—but the mother heard it not, until the door
softly opened, and a light touch upon her arm roused
her to consciousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Donald, Donald, I’m glad ye’re come,” was
her tremulous salutation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet, Maggie,” he said, “I’m not so sure o’
that when you see what I’ve brought you. I would
not add to your cares if I could help it, but I could
not leave a babe to perish in the cold snow to-night,”
and unfolding his plaid, he displayed to her astonished
eyes, a fair and beautiful infant, richly dressed, who,
as she took it tenderly in her arms, opened its large
dark-blue eyes, and smiled in her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Donald, how lovely!” she exclaimed, almost
forgetting for the moment her sorrow; but a glance
toward the couch again brought the tears to her eyes,
and again she sunk beside it, with the little stranger
in her arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the exertions of Donald, a brisk fire was soon
burning on the hearth, and the bright blaze disclosed
the table, with its neat white cloth, on which his
frugal repast was spread; but he seemed to think
little of his supper that night, for drawing near to the
bedside, he bent over his child with an earnest,
anxious expression on his manly features.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long has she been so, Maggie?” he asked,
in a low tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since noon,” was the reply, and her breath came
more quickly as Donald bent closer and closer to
the quiet face, placing his hand softly on the still
breast, and his lips to the dimpled mouth whence no
breath seemed issuing, then, with a stifled sigh as he
gazed lingeringly on those beautiful features, he
turned to his wife, who was looking up in his face
with that gaze of mute terror which says so much
more than words,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maggie, God has taken our Ally to be an angel
in Heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No loud exclamation of grief followed his words.
Tearless she stood with her eyes fixed upon her husband’s
face, as if unable to comprehend his meaning,
but, sinking on his knees beside her, and enfolding
her in his arms, he prayed from a full heart that God
would be with them in this their first trial. The
low, soothing tones of his voice unlocked the fountains
of the mother’s heart, and blessed tears came
to her relief. Long might she have indulged in
this luxury, but a faint cry awoke her maternal
sympathies. She had forgotten the babe so strangely
thrown upon her care, but now her gentle nature
could not think of self, while another was suffering
and in preparations for the comfort of her charge,
the first wild burst of anguish was passed through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will call her Ally, after our own lost one,
Donald. Surely God has sent her to soften this sore
trial to us, and we will love her as our own. May
He help us to submit. Oh, my Ally! my darling, my
precious one—can any one ever fill thy place? God
help us!”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The simple funeral was over; the last look had
been taken, and little Alice McLane was hidden from
the weeping eyes that still turned toward her lowly
resting-place, as if yet unwilling to leave her alone
beneath that cold, cold sod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald and Margaret McLane had been very
happy until now—too happy perhaps. They had
loved each other in early years, and when Donald
had earned enough by his own honest labor to purchase
the cottage on Burnside Moor, they were married
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
without a shadow on their young, hopeful
hearts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Margaret was a careful housewife, and Donald had
ever a warm welcome and comfortable home when,
wearied with his daily toil, he came back to her
whom he had promised to love and cherish; and
when little Alice came to gladden the young mother’s
lonely hours while he was away, sunshine reigned
in the household. In all their happiness they never
forgot who gave them all their blessings, and daily
was their morning and evening sacrifice of praise
sent up to their Heavenly Father in confiding and
child-like simplicity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cherished flower was Ally McLane, with her
bright blue eyes sparkling with joy and affection, her
round, dimpled, rosy cheeks, and baby tones, so
sweet to a parent’s ear; her mother’s sunny spirit
seemed hers from her very birth until the heavy hand
of sickness came down to hush those happy notes,
and dim the light of health and joyousness that ever
danced around her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps she was too fondly loved; perhaps their
hearts clung with too much of idolatry to their only
one; and a watchful Father saw that the ties must
be loosened. While yet her lisping tones seemed
ringing in their ears; while yet the flush of health
lingered on her cheek, the dart of the spoiler came,
and with scarce a pang of suffering to rend the
mother’s heart with deeper anguish, little Ally was
taken away from the ill to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Overwhelming as was the blow, a mitigation was
sent with it. The stranger babe thus thrown upon
Margaret’s tenderness, proved a solace which nothing
else could have afforded, and in the cares
attendant upon her new charge, the dreary sense of
loneliness, following the loss of a loved one, was
robbed of half its power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many were the wondering surmises of Donald and
his wife, in reference to the manner in which the
babe had been thus given to them. The dark mantle
in which it had been closely enfolded, had first attracted
Donald’s attention amid the snow-drifts, for
the little forsaken one was already wrapped in that
fatal slumber which, if not soon broken, knows no
waking—and the young man’s heart was melted with
kindly sympathy as he thought of his own darling, so
he raised the light burden from its soft but dangerous
resting-place, bore it to gentle and tender hands—and
as days, and weeks, and months wore away, no one
appearing to claim the lost one, closer and closer
their hearts were wound about her, till their love
seemed even as that they had borne their <span class='it'>own</span> angel
Ally—as they called her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes Margaret would almost forget that her
second Ally was not, indeed, the very same as that
one they had laid with such heart-yearnings beneath
the snow-clad turf; and yet the two were very
unlike. The face of the stranger was full of earnest
thought. Her large, dark, liquid eyes, so full of
dreamy tenderness, beamed with almost spiritual
beauty; and a hasty word would bring the tears to
her eyes, the warm blush to her cheek, and a strange
imploring expression over her whole countenance;
whereas her elder namesake was ever a joyous child,
light and graceful, full of the heedlessness so natural
to her tender age—and few things there were that
had power to dim her sunny spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Year after year sped on unmarked, save by the
introduction of one little stranger after another into
the once lonely household of Donald McLane. Alice,
their eldest and loveliest, had ripened gradually from
the beautiful child, their pet and plaything, to the
gentle, thoughtful girl of sixteen, watching with unwearied
care the slightest wish of her parents, (for
she knew not that they were otherwise,) and striving
by every means in her power to lighten their burdens.
The secret of her history had been carefully kept
from her as well as the fair-haired, happy flock around
them; for why should they sadden a life so unshadowed
as hers, with thoughts that must bring suffering to
her loving nature?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The promise of rare beauty which her infancy had
held out was more than realized. There was a
spirituality about those dark-blue eyes, in every
graceful movement—a native ease and sweetness
of manner so unusual among the classes in which
she moved—so unlike the frank, noisy ways and
ruddy countenances of her younger brothers and
sisters, that Margaret often gazed upon her with a
wondering sigh and a trembling of heart, she could
not tell why. Alice had been reared with more than
maternal tenderness—a fond yearning over her deserted
helplessness—a sympathy for those who must
have mourned the loss of such a child, together with
her own irresistible winningness, had led Margaret
unconsciously to indulge the child of her adoption
even more than the members of her own little flock;
but Ally was one of those rare natures in whom indulgence
only brings forth warmer, purer feelings of
love and gratitude, and even from babyhood, as
Margaret would often say, she seemed like an angel
sent down to them from Heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sweet Alice McLane had not arrived at the age of
sixteen without admirers. Lonely as was the situation
of the cottage, many had been attracted thither
by the fame of such a jewel. But there was a quiet
dignity and purity about the gentle girl that repulsed
the most presuming; and Ally was still, child-like,
happy in her home, without a wish to leave it, at
least so far as was known to her own heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was, indeed, one, who had been a play-fellow
from childhood, being the son of their only
neighbor within many miles, who was ever a welcome
guest at the cottage, beneath whose glance her
own never drooped, nor the painful blush rose to her
transparent cheek—and why was it? Because Dugald
Lindsay had never spoken of the trembling hopes that
lay nestling at his heart, though they had wandered
together for hours over the hills, or sat side by side
before the bright fire, in the winter evenings, while
he entertained them with merry tales; and though
Ally loved him dearly, yet it was with the pure,
happy love of a sister. So they lived from day to
day, unconscious of the cloud that was gathering over
the future happiness of one, and the brightest hopes
of the other.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Donald McLane was a hard-working man, and
seldom was any recreation beyond the quiet enjoyment
of his fire-side and home-circle indulged in. It
was therefore an occasion of no little joy among the
little folks, and perhaps not less so with the older
heads who showed less boisterous happiness, when,
on the return of the annual fair, a whole holyday was
promised with a visit to the village where it was
held.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the evening preceding the day so long and
anxiously looked for, a handsome traveling-carriage,
with servants and outriders, drove up to the inn door
of the village, creating an excitement among the
good people unheard of before. A tall, majestic,
and beautiful lady was assisted from it by a youth
whose noble and elegant appearance spoke of rank
and wealth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor landlord, confused, and almost paralyzed
by the unexpected honor conferred upon him, with
difficulty recalled his scattered senses in time to receive
his guests, and provide them with the best his
poor house could afford; but they, smiling at his
consternation, retired immediately to their apartments,
where, at their own request, a simple repast
was served, and they appeared no more that evening.
The servants were surrounded and eagerly questioned,
but nothing could be elicited from them, except
that the strangers were the Countess of Weldon
and her son, who were traveling for the benefit of
their health, impaired by the close air and dissipation
of London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning, just as the party from Burnside
Moor had reached the village, after a weary
walk of many miles, the coach drove up once more
to receive its noble inmates. Donald and Margaret
were foremost, and had already passed by, the
younger children following them; but Ally had
lingered somewhat in the rear, for Dugald was
beside her, and in earnest conversation they had unconsciously
slackened their pace, thus arriving opposite
the inn door just in time to see the carriage
drive up and the noble pair preparing to enter it.
Surprised out of her usual quiet demeanor, Ally
gazed eagerly at the novel sight. Her hood had
fallen back, and her soft brown curls came clustering
around her face, generally so pale, but now with
the warm blood <a id='tinge'></a>tingeing its snowy surface, and her
dark, dreamy eyes turned wonderingly toward the
strangers, she was lovely beyond description. At
this moment the countess turned her eyes in the
direction where Ally stood leaning on the arm of
her companion, and with a thrilling cry, stretched
out her arms toward her, then fell back insensible.
In an instant all was confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady was borne into the house, and all intruders
waved off; but Ally had never yet seen
suffering without endeavoring to relieve it, and
springing impulsively forward, she entered the inn,
followed by Dugald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the countess again opened her eyes, a sweet,
loving face looked into hers, and an arm, soft and
white as her own, supported her head. Another
wild exclamation burst from her quivering lips, and
again she sunk back, murmuring, “Adela, my sister—have
you come back from the spirit-world to bless
me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What ails you, dear lady,” said Ally, tenderly—“can
I do any thing for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time those who stood around the couch,
anxiously waiting the solution of this mystery, observed
a striking resemblance between the noble
stranger and the lovely peasant girl, who stood pale
and bewildered by her manner, yet unwilling to leave
her while yet she seemed to need assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, child,” said the countess, suddenly
rising from her recumbent position, “tell me, who
are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question was hasty, the tone almost harsh,
and Ally’s face flushed again, as she replied timidly,
“My name is Alice McLane, lady—my father lives
on Burnside Moor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is your father?—I must see him instantly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dugald turned in search of him, but Donald, having
quickly missed his daughter, had come back in search
of her, leaving the rest of his charge in a booth near
by, and was even now at the inn door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as his eye fell on the pale, agitated countenance
of the stranger, and from her to his idolized
daughter, every trace of color left both cheeks and
lips, and unable to support himself, he sunk into a
chair, covering his face with his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that brief moment he comprehended it all.
Sometimes, in past years, the unwelcome thought
would painfully force itself upon him, that his
precious Ally was not, indeed, his own. Hearts that
must have mourned her loss, might again rejoice
over their recovered treasure, but as year after year
went by undisturbed, Donald grew strong in hope,
and had almost banished every fear of the kind, when
this terrible realization of the worst came so suddenly
upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No wonder that his strong frame was bowed, and
his stout heart wrung with anguish, as he felt that even
resistance would be vain. No wonder that Ally
stood by him terrified at the sight of grief such as
never in her whole peaceful life had met her eyes
before. Her arms were thrown around him, her
warm kisses fell upon his cold brow, as she implored
him to unfold this mystery. The countess watched
him silently, yet a wild gleam of triumph flashed
from her dark eyes, as she exchanged glances with
her son, who stood looking on with no less appearance
of interest than herself. Dugald, fearing he
knew not what, only showed by his varying color,
the thoughts that thronged rapidly upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story was soon told, and none present could
doubt that Alice, the poor cottage-girl, was the
orphan niece of the proud countess, and through her,
heiress to untold wealth. And how did Ally receive
the news of her sudden elevation? With agony
that moved the little circle of auditors to tears,
as she clung wildly to the only father she had ever
known, and implored him not to send her away
from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald looked up with a sorrow-stricken expression
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>
on his manly face, saying, “See you not the
child’s distress, lady. Say no more now. Let her go
home with us once more. Time will reconcile her to
it, perhaps, but do not torture her now. God help
us! for He only knows how great is the love we bear
each other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He motioned to Dugald, whose countenance, like
his own, was ashy pale, but who, summoning the
strength that in these few brief moments of anguish
seemed to have deserted him, raised the almost insensible
form of the weeping girl, and bore her away
without resistance.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Forget you, Dugald! and do you think Ally so
changeful as to be carried away by the high-sounding
titles and useless baubles of this wicked world?
Could I be happier anywhere than I have been in
my own dear mountain home. My aunt has promised
that I shall return if I am not satisfied, and in
one twelvemonth we will meet again. Nothing shall
keep me from you if life is mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ally, dear Ally, you do not know the world you
are about entering. The rich and the great will be
there to court you, and the splendors that will glitter
around you, have dazzled many a stronger head,
though not a purer heart, Ally. But I ought not to
murmur, since this parting has brought me joy as
well as sorrow—since it has told me that you love
me, darling. God keep you in temptation, and bring
you back to us unchanged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so they parted. When did they meet again?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us now turn back in the page of by-gone years,
and trace the history of our little foundling so suddenly
raided to a station that the proudest might envy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clara and Adela Dundas were the daughters of an
English nobleman; their mother dying before they
had emerged from the school-room, they were left
without that guiding hand so necessary to the maiden
ignorant of the world, and heedless of warning from
less beloved lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clara, the eldest, married, at an early age, a wealthy
earl, the choice of her father, and departed to her
princely home, with a father’s blessing, leaving her
young, gentle sister more lonely than ever. Adela
had ever been of a clinging, dependent spirit, loving
with her whole heart the few objects she had as yet
found in life worthy or unworthy; and was it, then,
to be wondered at, when in the solitary hours after
her sister’s departure, her affectionate nature should
pine for some new companion on whom to pour out
the rich treasures of a heart that could not be satisfied
in selfish ends. Unhappily, the one on whom her
choice fell, was a poor, untitled gentleman, holding
an honorable office in her father’s household, but
on whom Lord Dundas looked as so far inferior to
his beautiful daughter in every respect, as never to
dream of danger in allowing the occasional intercourse
which passed between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Knowing as they both did the proud and immoveable
spirit of Lord Dundas, and hopeless of gaining
his consent to what in their own young hearts, full
of the romance of first love, seemed necessary to
their very existence, they fled—and the lovely Lady
Adela Dundas, who had never known one hour’s
privation from luxury, became, in a poor Highland
cottage, the wife of him for whom she had forsaken
all—father, friends and home. A letter was written
more from the warm feelings of affection and respect
than from any hope of moving the stern parent whom,
as Adela felt, they had offended past forgiveness—and
so it proved—an answer came, only to announce
her disinheritance, and exile for life from her father’s
home and heart. Then was it that Adela for the
first time felt the fearful consequences of her rash
step, and it needed all the persuasions and soothing
caresses of a husband whom she loved tenderly, to
bring her to any degree of composure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After many months of suffering and privation,
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
during which time her sister had privately sent her
aid whenever she could do so with impunity, Mr.
Moreton obtained employment which again raised
them to comfort if not affluence. A lovely infant
now brought new hopes and new feelings into poor
Adela’s sorrowful heart, and to her husband’s delight
she became once more cheerful. Sorely had they
suffered for their sin, yet kind and gentle and loving
to each other they had ever been. Poverty had not
had power to dampen the pure affection of earlier
days, and its calm light shone upon their paths with
a hopeful radiance even in the darkest hours of their
probation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little Adela was but a few months old when
a letter arrived from the steward of Lord Dundas,
with a hasty summons to the death-bed of the now
relenting parent. Sorrow and joy struggled for pre-eminence
in Lady Adela’s bosom, as she hastily prepared
to obey; but a new difficulty now arose. The
winter had just set in with great severity—the journey
was a long and fatiguing one; Adela spurned all
objections on her own part, but her babe, how could
she expose it to the inclemency of the weather, and
the dangers that must attend them. Brief and bitter
was the conflict—but the child was left in the care
of a faithful nurse, who promised to watch over it as
her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They arrived only in time to receive the parting
blessing of their beloved father, and after the requisite
arrangements of the estate, which was equally
divided between the two sisters; it was settled that
Adela should now remain at the castle, at least until
some further disposal of the property should be made,
and that Mr. Moreton should return for the child, as
the spring would soon open with sunshine and air,
balmy enough even for the little traveler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Days and weeks dragged slowly their way along
to the young wife, now, for the first time since her
hasty marriage, separated from her husband. He
came at last—but he came alone! Short and terrible
was the tale his pale lips had to utter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman in whose care the babe had been left,
faithfully watched over it, never resigning her charge
to another, save when necessity required.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One cold but bright, sunshiny day, having occasion
to go to the neighboring village, she wrapped the
child carefully in a heavy mantle, and set out with it
in her arms on her errand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that time neither nurse nor babe had been
heard of. A violent snow-storm came on toward
night, and it was feared that both had perished, yet
singular to tell, no trace of their bodies had been discovered
on the road wherein their way led.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silently the young mother listened to these crushing
words. Hope itself was extinct, and from that day,
though every endearing care that love could devise
was lavished upon her, sweet Lady Adela drooped
like a frail lily, growing paler and weaker, yet ever
gentle, patient and loving to the last—for ere the
spring flowers had faded, a husband and sister wept
bitter tears over her early grave. So young and so
lovely, thus Ally’s fair mother died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Comparing this sorrowful tale with Donald’s account,
it was inferred that the woman, returning
from the village, became bewildered by the snowstorm,
and turned in the direction of Donald’s cottage
instead of that leading to her own, which was directly
opposite, and losing her way, had wandered on until
wearied with her heavy burden, and hopeless of
saving both lives, had deserted her charge, and proceeded,
unencumbered, to find shelter for her own
exhausted frame. In this, perhaps, she succeeded;
but with the consciousness of safety came the harrowing
reflections of her faithlessness, and unable to
meet those she had so wronged, she had most probably
left the country, for no trace of her was ever
discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Moreton did not long survive his idolised
wife; and now, when our gentle Ally awoke to the
proud consciousness of rank, wealth, a new name
and new relations, the tidings brought only sorrow
and suffering to one so loving and happy as she had
been—for was she not an orphan? Bitter tears
flowed at the recital of her mother’s history, but
turning from all the allurements and persuasions that
were lavished upon her by her new aunt and cousin,
she flung herself on Margaret’s bosom, saying, “I
have one mother still! oh, let me stay—let me stay!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet as we have seen, Ally did go at last, pale and
sorrowful, but with a kind word for all, and bidding
them not to weep, for she would soon return—“She
knew she would not love the great world of London.
Oh, no! she would soon be back, never, never to
leave them again!”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Twelve months had passed by, lingeringly to the
little lonely band on Burnside Moor, and sunshine
seemed to spring up afresh in every heart when the
first tiny green leaves and blue-eyed violets peeped
through the snow. “The spring is coming,” shouted
the children, gleefully, “the spring is coming, and
Ally will soon be here.” The shadow passed off
from the mother’s thoughtful brow, and Donald looked
happier than he had yet since the parting, but Dugald
grew more and more silent—as each budding tree
put forth its tiny sprouts and the verdure became
brighter and fresher on the hill-side, the flush paled
on his cheek and his dark eyes grew heavy with
thought. Week after week glided on, and the children
wearied with watching turned with eager questions
to their elders, but mournfully, eyes dim with
tears, met theirs—still Ally came not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The warm harvest days stole on—the grain was
all gathered in—the cool autumn winds blew chillingly—the
snow flakes again robed the earth in their
pure mantle, and still Ally came not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bitter as was the disappointment, it fell not on unsubmissive
hearts. The children alone were clamorous
in their expressions of regret, but like the summer
cloud, the sorrow passed from their memories
and they found in present amusements that forgetfulness
which others sought in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sick with hope deferred,” they mourned unceasingly
their lost one—yet upheld by that faith in a
Heavenly Guardian, to whose care they had given
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
her, and who would be faithful to the trust though all
earth should conspire against them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And where was the object of this fond solicitude?
What fate had been hers since she tore herself away
weeping, yet strong in hope and confidence, fearless
of the temptations, whose power she had yet to
learn? Was she indeed changed? Could not the
shield of love and innocence, so close about her,
guard every avenue of that guileless heart? Alas!
no; Ally had been too trustful in her own strength,
and so insidious was the approach of the evil-spirit
that she was unconscious of danger until bitterly
awakened to self-reproach, to feel that it was too
late!</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the Lady Adela Moreton, co-heiress with her
cousin of their grandfather’s broad lands, she was
courted, caressed and flattered by the noblest and
most wealthy—her own rare loveliness adding new
attractions to her proud triumph, and though at first
pained—then disgusted—sad to tell—she at length
learned to love the adulation that followed her steps.
Her cheek would flush and her eye brighten with conscious
pride—yet beautiful as she then was in the
eyes of a gazing world, Dugald would almost have
failed to recognize in her his own pure-hearted
love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her aunt had been steadily pursuing a scheme
which had been busy in her brain since the first unlooked
for recognition of her sister’s long lost child,
which was the union of her eldest son, Sir Frederic,
to his beautiful cousin, and thus preserve undivided
the family estate. Poor Ally little dreamed of the
snares that were laid for her. The kindness of her
aunt won her gentle, affectionate heart to implicit
obedience, and her handsome cousin, possessed of
every art of pleasing—beauty, rank, wealth, grace,
(few could resist their united influence,) moved her
by every loving device.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was Ally happy? Those who saw her in the festive
halls, brilliant and animated, the centre to which
all eyes, all hearts turned, might have deemed her
happy—but in the solitude of her chamber, when
lights and flattering tones had fled, pale, sorrowful
faces would rise up, as if upbraiding her; memories of
the past would so flit before her, searing her brain as
it were fire, and remorseful tears would flow through
the long sleepless nights, stealing away the freshness
from her fair cheek, the brightness from her eyes.
Was this happiness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the golden chains were close around her, and
Ally asked not to break their glittering links.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald—Margaret—Dugald—a fearful snare is
weaving around your darling one—a little longer and
she may be lost to you forever—save her if yet you
may—God speed your efforts, for man is powerless
now.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Another spring had come. Calmly and gently as
on the heart-sick watchers fell the last rays of the
setting sun on Ally’s weary brow as she sat by the
window of her boudoir listlessly gazing into the
street. Gay dresses were strewed around her—jewels
flashed from their velvet cushions upon the
dressing-table beside her, and ornaments of rich and
varied style lay beside them—yet Ally’s thoughts
seemed far away. Her sweet face was paler and
thinner, and on her dimpled mouth lay that peculiar
expression of suffering which the lips only can show
forth—her dark-blue eyes seemed larger, and a wild
look had taken the place of the soft dove-like glances
which had won Dugald’s heart. Oh! Ally was fearfully
changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, as though an ice-bolt had stricken her,
the young girl started from her dreamy posture. The
color faded from her parted lips and she clung to the
window sill as she gazed at some object below.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
A young Highlander, in the garb of his native hills,
had just passed by, and even now paused before the
arched gate-way of that princely mansion. Ally
looked no longer, but sinking upon her knees, she
wept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few moments afterward, her slight form might
have been seen gliding down the wide staircase and
entering a small library adjoining the drawing-room,
with which a glass door communicated—softly the
curtain was lifted, while with clasped hands and a
frame shivering with the intensity of her agitation
she saw and heard all that passed within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dugald, her own wronged Dugald was there—she
had not been deceived then in that hasty glimpse of
his figure from the window. A chill crept over
Ally’s heart as she saw his pale face and sorrowful
look—but this was as nothing to the agony that
thrilled through her ere long. Dugald sat in one of
the richly embroidered chairs, with the graceful ease
so natural to him in any society, while directly opposite,
in a large arm-chair with a cushion beneath
her feet, sat the countess. An air of haughty indifference
was meant, perhaps, to check the young
man’s hopes, for well did the proud lady know the
object of his long journey, and sorely did she tremble
lest her plans should yet be defeated. Leaning carelessly
on a massive table close by, with an air that
affected to be contemptuously easy, while the working
of his fine features betrayed an inward conflict,
stood Sir Frederic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I assure you, sir, Lady Adela is too much indisposed
to see any one this evening,” were the first
words that the trembling girl heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, if she is ill, lady, do not refuse to let me see
her. Surely, surely, news from home would do her
good—oh, never was she too ill yet to see Dugald!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only let me see her for a moment—let me hear
from her own lips that she has forgotten us.” And
the young man grew eloquent as he pictured in the
simple language of exquisite pathos, the more touching
as it came every word from a full heart, the distress
of those who loved and watched for their absent
one till their hearts grew faint within them. He told
of their bitter disappointments—their home now over-shadowed
because the sunbeam that once lighted it
was gone. He spoke not of his own feelings for they
were too sacred to be displayed before the cold natures
that listened unmoved even now—and Dugald
ceased with a sinking heart as he watched their
haughty brows grow darker with suppressed anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The countess rose and with a frigid salutation left
the room, and her son, with an expression of withering
scorn, demanded how he dared to expect that <span class='it'>his</span>
cousin remembered or wished to know aught of
such low associations—then followed his mother,
leaving Dugald stunned and motionless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In those few brief moments the evil spirit had departed
from Ally’s misguided soul and the good regained
its influence over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the last echoing sound of the departing footsteps,
she opened the door against which she had
been leaning, with that temporary strength excitement
ever gives—she beckoned to the startled
youth, who, half-dreaming, obeyed the signal, and
found himself face to face with her whom he had just
deemed lost to him forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ally, dear Ally, what have they done to change
you thus,” he exclaimed as he stretched out his arms
toward her. She threw herself weeping upon his
bosom, clinging to him as if fearful of being again
torn away. “Take me home, Dugald, take me
home. Thank God I am not quite heartless yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tenderly as a mother soothes her restless child, did
Dugald caress and whisper sweet words of comfort
to the trembling one he folded to his heart—and at
last she looked up through her tears with her old familiar
smile, so that she seemed almost herself
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By a side-door Dugald reached the street, unobserved
by those who deemed him long since gone—a
light was in his eye, his step was free and elastic,
and his whole face beamed with the inward delight
that caused his heart to throb wildly as he traversed
the streets toward his temporary residence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few hours passed and he came forth again—when
he returned he was no longer alone. Like her
gentle mother, Adela Moreton fled from wealth and
rank to share the lowlier lot of him who had won
her heart. But unlike that mother our sweet mountain
flower fled from the evil to the stern yet blessed
path of duty, and the blessing of Heaven followed
upon her steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great was the amazement of the countess and her
too sanguine heir when on the following morning
they discovered that their dove had escaped from the
net laid for her. Bitter were the curses that descended
on Dugald’s now unconscious head, but the
affectionate little note left on the table of the vacant
boudoir, showed too plainly by its gentle but decided
tenor that further hope was vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sunshine came back into Donald’s cottage—laughter
and mirth were no longer strangers there,
for Ally, their “lost and found,” had returned to
them, paler and thinner it is true, and with a deeper
shadow on her fair brow, but with her loving heart
and gentle voice unchanged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ally well knew the sacrifice she made, but it was
made willingly. Her wealth was all in the power of
her aunt, and she hoped for no concession from the
disappointed schemers—but Dugald had not been idle
during the years of his probation, and he was no
longer a poor man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One bright summer’s day when all nature seemed
rejoicing and human hearts were filled with thankfulness,
in her own simple cottage-dress, and under her
old name of Alice McLane which she had again
adopted, Ally, now blooming and happy, stood before
the altar in their own dear kirk, and promised to
be the wife of him who had loved her so long and so
faithfully. Joy beamed from every countenance, as
they now felt that no power on earth might rend these
ties, and Ally, their own beautiful Ally, was theirs till
death should part them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only once did the proud countess seek to recall
her flown bird to her glittering but uneasy nest, and
the day on which she arrived with Sir Frederic,
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
eager and hopeful, was Ally’s wedding-day, and so
they became unwittingly sharers in that beautiful
scene—the only angry spirits in all that peaceful band
of worshipers. Baffled again, they left without even
seeking an interview with the object of their long
journey, and Ally never heard of them again until the
arrival of a strange-looking epistle many years after,
announcing the death of her aunt, and her own accession
by right of birth to the half of Lord Dundas’
princely fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sweet Ally McLane! would that more angels like
thee in the likeness of sinful flesh might dwell among
us—raising our hearts to higher, holier purposes, and
fitting us while here for a better home above, where
envy, malice, pride, or sorrow never may be known
or felt.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY PROFESSOR ALDEN.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle, have you a fowling-piece to lend me?”
said Henry Deforest, on the morning after his arrival
at Beech Grove, whither he had come to enjoy a brief
interval of rest from his professional studies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” replied Mr. Woolcott, “as fine a one as you
ever handled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want to do with it, pray?” said
Aunt Martha, Mr. Woolcott’s maiden sister and housekeeper,
who, like a sensible woman, believed that
guns and gunpowder were infernal inventions, and
dangerous in every possible shape and shade of combination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have some thoughts of taking a gunning excursion,”
said Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you a good shot?” said Mr. Woolcott.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About equal to Mr. Winkle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know him—where does he live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry was happily relieved from the necessity of
replying to the question of his matter-of-fact uncle, by
Aunt Martha, who declared her somewhat exulting
belief that the gun was lent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it is at home—it came home last night. Here it
is,” said Mr. W., bringing it forth from a secure hiding-place
constructed under Aunt Martha’s sole direction
and authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it loaded?” said Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I guess not,” said his uncle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll warrant it is,” said Aunt Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is there to shoot in these parts?” said Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boys,” replied Aunt M., rather sharply. “Mr.
Johns shot one last week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boys are not good to eat, my dear aunt, and I cannot
in conscience shoot any thing not good to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Martha uttered an inarticulate aspiration which
signified that she should lose her temper if she said any
thing more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Woolcott, who had been quite a rustic sportsman
in his younger days, furnished his nephew with a
liberal allowance of powder, shot and wadding, and
the said nephew sallied forth with murderous intentions
toward all feathered bipeds possessing the attribute
of being good to eat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was early in June. The sweet breath of the
morning spoke so lovingly of peace and gentleness,
that he began to question the propriety of his savage
purposes. His conscience, or his good sense, or his
humanity, or something else, suggested, that to pollute
the flower-laden breeze with sulphurous vapors, and
to hush the sweet music of God’s innocent creatures,
was not the most fitting employment for one proud of
his immortality. He had not a very definite idea of the
pleasures of bird-murder—in fact, that it might be a
source of pleasure to him at all, it would be necessary
for him to “make believe” with as much intensity as
did “the small servant,” when she used orange-peel
water for wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He soon reached a beautiful meadow. In consequence
of his admiration of the lilies and daisies which
adorned it, he failed to observe the meadow-larks that
frequently rose before him, and uttered their notes of
gladness to the mounting sun. At length one rose from
his very feet. In an instant his finger was upon the
trigger; but the sweet note of his intended victim
charmed him. While he listened, the bird passed beyond
the range of his weapon. Perhaps he mentally
compared the pleasure of listening to its song with that
of witnessing its dying gaspings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The murmuring of a streamlet fell upon his ear. In
a moment he was bending over its pure, bright waters.
A large, smooth stone, shaded by a clump of willows,
invited him to a seat. He laid aside his weapon, and
sat down, baring his forehead to the breeze, and fixing
his eyes upon the tiny inhabitants of the rivulet, his
thoughts took the peaceful hue of the objects around
him. It was not till the changing shadows of the willows
exposed him to the rays of the sun, that he became
conscious of the flight of time. He then rose and
went to a small grove which clothed the summit of a
gentle elevation in the vicinity. The grove was composed
of saplings, about twenty feet in height. As he
entered it, a false step led him to cast his eye downward.
He had planted his foot in the hollow of a
sunken grave. On looking around him, he found he
was in the midst of an ancient grave-yard. The headstones
which marked the resting places of the sleepers,
had apparently been taken from a neighboring ledge.
Only one bore an inscription, or had received the impress
of the chisel. He looked in vain for a new-made
grave. It was long since the funeral-train had entered
that grave-yard—long since the mourner had come
thither to weep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deforest had visited cemeteries in which wealth had
lavished its treasures, and art exhausted its resources
in order to disrobe death of his gloom. No splendid
mausoleum, no carefully penned epitaph, so disposed
him to reflection, as did the leaf-filled hollows and rude
stones of that neglected grave-yard. He spent an hour
in serious thought, and was about to leave the place,
when the sound of approaching footsteps arrested his
attention. He turned and saw an aged man entering
the grove. The stranger approached the grave near
which Deforest was standing. He appeared slightly
embarrassed when he perceived that he was not alone.
He returned the courteous salutation of Deforest, and
seemed disposed to converse with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not live in these parts?” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am on a visit to my uncle, Mr. Woolcott. I reside
in the city,” said Deforest.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
“Your uncle came into the place after I left it. I was
born here, in a house that stood on the knoll yonder.
That cluster of bushes stands where the hearth-stone
used to lie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I noticed, as I passed the spot this morning, that a
building once stood there. It must have been a long
time ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sixty-nine years ago, last March, I was born in that
house, or rather in the house which stood there then.
This country then was a wilderness. There was one
log-house where the village now stands, and one between
this and the river. I have not lived here for more
than forty years. Latterly I go through the place once a
year, as I go for my pension, and I always come to this
spot. My father lies here, and—another friend. I always
come and look upon the place of their rest. They do not
know it. It does not do them any good, but it does
me good. This is the grave of my father,” laying his
hand on the stone noticed above as being the only one
which bore an inscription. The inscription was as
follows: “James Hampton, died July 16, 1777, aged
forty-five years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man uncovered his head as he laid his hand
upon the stone, and gazed in silence upon the earth
which lay above the remains of his parent. Deforest
felt that he was an intruder, and was about to retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not go,” said the stranger. “I never met any
one here before. It seems like meeting with a friend.
That is a feeling which persons as old as I am seldom
experience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deforest, whose warm heart was strongly interested
in the aged stranger, gladly accepted his invitation to
remain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were young when your father died,” said he,
looking again at the inscription.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was in my fourteenth year. He was killed by a
rifle-ball, in an attack made upon the house by a party
of Indians. I have no doubt they were led by a tory
who lived in a house which stood behind the ridge
yonder, to the east. My friends wished to have it put
on the tombstone that he was shot by the Indians. I
believed that the shot which killed him was fired by a
neighbor. I would not have the stone tell an untruth;
so nothing is said about the manner of his death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should be greatly interested in hearing an account
of the matter, if it be not painful to you to relate it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come and sit down on this rock and I will tell you
all about it. It happened more than fifty years ago, yet
it is as fresh in my mind as if it had happened yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led the way to a large moss-covered rock, which
afforded them a comfortable seat under the shade of a
thicket of young chestnuts. Near it was a grave on
which the old man’s eyes were fastened. He did not
seem disposed to resume the conversation. A tear
ran down his furrowed cheek. Deforest sympathized
with him in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must ask me questions, my young friend,”
said he, somewhat abruptly, “or my mind will wander
away from the things you wish me to speak of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did your father build the house in which you were
born?” said Deforest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he came here about ten years before the war,
when, as I said before, there was only one house between
this and the river. I was born the year after
the house was built. I was but a little over ten years
old when the troubles with England came on. My
father and mother had many consultations upon the
question, whether it was best for them to return to the
east or not. There were no Indians near, and there
was nothing to call them—for nearly all the people
along the river were friends to the king. My father
was from Massachusetts, and of course, liberty was
natural to him; but he had said little or nothing about
matters in dispute, for the very good reason that there
were but very few persons to converge with. So he
concluded to remain here. I could see that my mother
did not feel easy. She grew thin and pale, and seemed
unwilling to have us out of her sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once in a while, a rumor of what was going on
reached us, though the accounts were always in favor
of the king’s troops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In June of the year ’77, one day, as my father was
in the cornfield, he saw an Indian skulking behind a
large tree in the woods, that then stood where those
oats are now growing. He continued at his hoeing
for an hour or two, and was careful not to indicate by
his appearance that he had seen any thing unusual.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was he not afraid that the Indian’s bullet might
put an end to his work?” said Deforest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he reasoned in this way. If the object of the
Indian had been to kill him on the spot, he would have
done so before he was seen. When my father came
to the house, he was not disposed to say any thing about
what had occurred, for he was not willing to give unnecessary
alarm to his family. His anxious countenance
led to inquiries which revealed the true state of
the case. He began at once to make preparation to
resist an attack, which he anticipated would be made
in the night. I was employed in casting bullets, while
he was busy in barricading the windows, and in making
openings between the logs to serve as port-holes.
Night at length drew near, and we sat down to supper,
sad and silent, feeling that in all probability it was the
last meat we should ever take together. The night
passed slowly on. None of us were disposed to sleep.
About midnight my father persuaded my mother to lie
down, with my sister, who was sleeping unconscious
of danger. Very soon there was a gentle knocking at
the door. We had no light burning. My father had
his rifle in his hand, while I held a musket, ready to
exchange with him as soon as he had fired. He crept
silently to the port-hole that commanded the door. He
saw an Indian, with a rifle, standing before the door.
The moonbeams fell full on his face, the expression of
which left no doubt on my father’s mind respecting the
object of the visit. The knocking was repeated. The
answer was the discharge of the rifle from the port-hole.
The Indian bounded high in the air, and fell to
the earth a corpse. A yell from about half a dozen
voices in the vicinity revealed the probable number of
our foes. We were greatly encouraged, for it seemed
well-nigh certain that their numbers would be so far
diminished ere they could effect an entrance, as to
render the result of the conflict by no means doubtful.
The opening from which the shot was fired did not
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
command the approach to the door. This was probably
observed by our enemies, and after some time,
apparently spent in consultation, two of them took a
long, heavy pole from the fence, and drew near with
the evident purpose of using it as a battering-ram to
force the door. My father placed himself before an
opening which he had made for the purpose of commanding
the approach to the door, and when they were
near enough to make the aim sure, he fired, and the
hindmost man fell, never to rise again. I instantly
gave my father the musket, and he fired at the other
man, who had made a brief halt before he commenced
his retreat. Either because the smoke prevented a
good aim, or the musket carried ball less accurately
than the rifle, the Indian did not fall, but from the blood
that marked his retreat, it appeared that he was
severely wounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We could see a group of four or five persons in the
distance. They were not quite near enough to make
a sure shot, and my father thought it of the utmost importance
that every ball should tell. While our attention
was fixed upon them, a light shone in from a
crevice on the side of the house opposite to the door.
On that side there was neither door nor window. The
enemy had sent one of their number, who had procured
a bundle of straw from the barn, and placed it
against the side of the logs, and set fire to it. It was
their object to burn us alive, or to shoot us down when
attempting to extinguish the flames. From the crevice
which revealed the fire, my father saw an Indian
grinning like a demon as he watched the progress of
the flames. The good rifle soon put him out of the
way of doing any more mischief. He then seized a
pail of water, and ran to the chamber, and removed a
board from the roof, and poured the water upon the
fire. He had loosened the board in the course of his
preparations for defense, thinking it possible that the
opening might afford a means of escape. Fortunately
the opening was immediately over the spot where the
fire was kindled. Three of our foes had now been
killed, and one of them wounded, (though we did not
know it till the next day,) and we hoped they would
become discouraged and retire. We heard nor saw
nothing of them for an hour or more, though we kept
watch in every direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A new danger revealed itself. The fire had not
been wholly extinguished; it had caught in the logs,
and now began to blaze. My father took a bucket of
water and went to the roof as before, but the moment
his head appeared, three or four rifles were discharged
from the grove near by. One of the balls slightly
grazed his cheek. He had the presence of mind to
make immediate application of the water before they
had time to reload, but he did not succeed in applying
it to the spot where it was most needed. Before another
pailfull could be procured, they had loaded their
pieces. He raised his hat above the opening in the
roof, in hopes that they would all fire, that he might
then extinguish the flames before they could reload.
Only one shot, however, was fired. It pierced the hat,
which fell. A savage yell of triumph caused our blood
to curdle. The hat was raised again, and another shot
fired, and another, both of which missed it. The
water was then poured on the fire; but just as he was
descending the stairs, a ball, apparently fired at random,
passed through the clay between the logs, and
entered his neck. He told us that he should bleed
to death in a few minutes, but encouraged us to hope
that the enemy would retire without any further efforts.
He told me to keep a vigilant watch, and to shoot down
those that came near the house. ‘Take care of your
mother and sister,’ said he, ‘take them to the east
if—’ he never finished the sentence. He bled to death
in spite of all we could do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man paused in his narrative, and again
fixed his eyes upon the grave noticed above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was the attack renewed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, they went off before daylight, leaving their
dead unburied. I dug a grave in the cellar, and buried
my father. We then took our horses, and were on
the other side of the river before night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you not afraid of being waylaid and murdered?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were, chiefly from the fact that so many of
the Indians had been killed. We felt safe when we
had crossed the river. We went to my mother’s
native place, and remained there till the war was over,
when we returned here. I was in the army during
the last year of the war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should hardly have thought that your mother
would have been willing to return here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had a good farm here, and several families
from her native place concluded to come with us and
settle here. By cultivating the farm I could fulfill my
father’s command to take care of my mother and
sister, and I did not see how I could do it in any other
way. The first thing I did was to bury my father in
this place. Several years afterward this stone, which
marks his grave, was brought on from the east.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told me you thought the shot which killed
your father was fired by a neighbor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had no suspicion of any such thing at the
time. As was natural, I kept the ball that caused the
death-wound. It was of a peculiar size, and had a
singular mark upon it. After my return, I happened
one day to be present where there were a number of
persons shooting at a mark. Alter they had finished
their sport, the boys began to cut the balls out of the
tree on which the mark had been placed. I was standing
near and happened to hear one say, ‘that was
Sawyer’s ball. I can always tell his ball by this mark.’
I looked at the ball, and saw that it bore the same
mark as the one that was taken from my father’s neck.
I put it into my pocket, and went home and compared
it with the ball I had preserved. The size and marks
corresponded perfectly. I then went to the boy and
found that all Sawyer’s balls had the same mark.
There was something in the bore of the rifle that made
a peculiar crease in the ball as it was forced out. I
then got a neighbor to inquire of Sawyer how long he
had owned his rifle, and I found that it was in his possession
before the war came on. My suspicions were
then strongly excited. It was not probable that there
were two rifles that would make the same impression
upon the ball discharged from them. I remembered,
too, that Sawyer had expressed great surprise at our
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
return, and had appeared somewhat embarrassed when
he met me. I met him in the street one day, and took
the ball out of my pocket and held it before him, and
fixing my eye fully upon his, asked him if he had ever
seen it? He turned very red, and then came near
fainting. I laid my hand upon him. He trembled
like a leaf. I repeated the question in a louder tone,
for I was sure that the murderer of my father was before
me. His lips moved, but he could not speak.
‘Do you think,’ said I, ‘that it is safe for you to stay
in this country?’ I flung him from me, and went on
my way. The next day he left for the west, and some
time afterward sent for his family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long did you live here after your return?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nearly ten years; I lived here till my mother
died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she buried here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, she died while we were on a visit to the east.
She was buried among her kindred. After her death,
I returned here and remained till I helped fill up that
grave,” pointing to the one which he had gazed at so
earnestly when he took his seat upon the rock.
“Then I felt there was nothing more to keep me here—in
fact, I felt that I could not live here. My sister
was married at the East; so I sold the farm and became
a wanderer. I did not visit the place for nearly twenty
years. When the pension-law was passed, I had occasion
to come here, for one who was in the same company
with me lived here. Since then, I have commonly
passed through the place once a year, and I
always visit this spot. This is the first time I ever
met any one here. I once thought of having the bushes
cut down; but on the whole, I concluded to let it grow
up to wood. It will shield the graves from the gaze
of the careless passer-by; and I like, too, the idea of
having the birds sing over her grave. Farewell,”
said he, rising and extending his hand. Henry returned
the warm pressure of his hand, and was retiring,
that he might be left alone by the sepulchre of his
parent. The stranger, however, kept by his side till
he reached the stone wall which separated the grove
from the meadow. He seemed unwilling to part with
his new acquaintance. Henry laid his hand upon his
shoulder, and said, “Will you not tell me about <span class='it'>her</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a moment’s silence the stranger replied,
“Young man, I will, though it is many a year since I
have pronounced her name aloud, unless I have done
so in my dreams. They say I often talk in my sleep.
I often dream of her, and sometimes it seems so much
like reality, that I cannot help weeping when I awake,
and find it nothing but a dream. She lived in a house
which stood beyond the hill yonder. I have never
seen it since the day she was carried out of it, and I
shall never see it again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her name?” whispered Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary Everson lies in that stoneless grave—I
wanted no stone to keep her in my memory, and I
wanted nothing to call strangers to her resting-place.
The world never contained a purer and warmer heart.
She came here with her uncle about a year before my
mother’s death. Her father had been wealthy, and
had taken great pains with her education. He lost his
property in time of the war, and died soon afterward.
His wife soon followed him, and Mary became dependent
upon her uncle, who removed here, as I said,
about a year before my mother died. I saw her, for
the first time, at a meeting in a log school-house. She
was seated opposite me, and I thought I never set eyes
on so fair an object. I have seen countenances which
would form better subjects for description, but I never
saw one which spoke to the soul like hers. It was
transparent. It seemed as though you could see the flow
of her pure thoughts and the beatings of her warm heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It so happened that on the next day I had occasion
to see her uncle on business. As I drew near the
house, I heard the loud and angry voice of a female.
I soon saw Mary coming down the foot-path. She
was sobbing. ‘O, mother,’ said she, ‘I am glad that
you do not know what your poor child has to suffer.’
She looked up and saw me with tears in my eyes—the
words she had spoken brought them there—and felt,
as she afterward told me, that I sympathized with
her. I passed her without speaking, transacted my
business with her uncle, and took my leave as speedily
as possible, hoping to meet with her on my return.
But I was disappointed. She had gone into a retired
thicket to unburthen her grief by prayer. The truth
was, her aunt treated her with great cruelty. Her
uncle had little power to protect her. I made an errand
there the next day, and found Mary alone. We sped
rapidly in our acquaintance, and our parting was like
that of old familiar friends. I became a frequent
visiter at Mr. E.’s house. He received me cordially,
but his wife, I could see plainly, disapproved my visits,
and the more as it became evident that Mary and I
were attached to each other. When it was known to
her that we were engaged to be married, she became
outrageous in her treatment of the poor orphan. She
caused her many days of bitterness, and many nights
of weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were to be married on my return from a visit
with my mother to the east. My mother never returned.
As soon as she was buried I hastened here,
and found Mary ill of an inflammation of the lungs.
The disease was brought on by exposure occasioned
by the cruelty of Mrs. E.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I watched by her bedside till she died. When she
was laid in the grave, I felt that there was a void in
my heart that could never be filled. Nearly half a
century has passed—the shadow of no earthly attachment
has ever fallen for a moment on the place in my
heart which belongs to her. The grave, as you see,
is no longer a hillock—the coffin has fallen in—the
heart that loved me so truly has mouldered, but her
memory is as fresh as when I felt the last feeble pressure
of her hand, or when I passed the whole night on
her grave before I left the place. Men have called
me indolent, irresolute, weak; but they knew not of
the shadow which rested upon my path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of late, I trust, I have known something of the
higher life which her dying lips entreated me to live.
I am waiting for my appointed time, when I shall meet
her in a world where affection is never blighted, and
separation is unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never said as much as I have now to any
mortal; you seem to be capable of sympathizing with
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
one. May your young heart find one whom it may
love as entirely as I loved her; and may she be spared
to you, that your life may not, like mine, be wasted.
Farewell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned and walked into the grove. Henry set
out on his return to his uncle’s house. On his way,
he thought of his gun with which he was to do such
execution. He returned to the place where he had
left it. It had fallen into the water, and was apparently
an object of great curiosity to the shiners who surrounded
the lock in great numbers. A frog sat resting
on his elbows on the opposite bank, surveying the examination.
When the gun was lifted from the water,
he disappeared with a sound rather indicative of contempt
either for the gun or its possessor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Martha received Henry with smiles, when she
was assured that he had not silenced any innocent
songsters, and her complacency was positive when she
learned the manner in which the gun had been disposed
of during the morning. She suggested that it
would be an improvement if it were kept under water
all the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How little can we of this latitude, or rather of this
country, for latitude seems not to rule in all cases with regard
to temperature; on one side of a continent, that
parallel which gives agreeable winters and dry, healthful
summers, is marked on the other side with cold,
snowy winters and most unhealthful summers; what the
<a id='var'></a>variant circumstances are which produce this difference
it is not easy to tell; the difference <span class='it'>does</span> exist, and
ingenious theories have been constructed to suit those
results; we say then again, how little can we of this
latitude, or this country, judge of the enjoyments which
others at a distance from us, but with the same shadows,
have in the dry coolness of their evenings, or lassitude
to which they are subject by the peculiar warmth
which prevails during most of their summer days.
The habits and customs among us are soon made conformable
to the circumstances of our climate; though
it must be confessed that people will always pertinaciously
insist on a warm day on the first of May, and a
stinging cold one on the 25th of December, while actual
experience has shown that the thin floral garb adopted
for the first has often led to consumption, and the
winter furs and the great Yule-log that have distinguished
the latter, have been considered rather <span class='it'>seasonable</span>
than pleasant. So much for a poetical conformity,
but in the every-day business of life things are
better disposed of; people do not think in this country
of sitting under their own <span class='it'>vine</span> till mid-summer, and
then they look out for spiders; and as to their fig-trees,
nobody gets under them unless it be the house-cat for
a summer <span class='it'>siesta</span>. While eastward of the shores of
the Mediterranean, people stretch themselves out upon
the house-top for a comfortable night’s sleep, and
spend a warm summer’s day beneath the cording
shadow of the fig or the olive, and make life itself a
blessing, not the means of enjoyment, but enjoyment
itself; life and its accidents, the gratification of simple
appetites—eating, drinking, and sleeping. Leaving
to others the profitless toils that accumulate heaps of
gold, only a portion of which can ever be used, and
that portion will buy little more than what may be had
and enjoyed without it. In this country we retreat
away from an oppressive heat or a stinging cold, and
make the absence of either an excuse for our merriment.
In that other land to which we have referred,
positive enjoyment is had in the uses of the evening
air, and the contemplation of the heavenly hosts. Stars
and planets twinkling in the clear blue ether above,
not larger than seen from this continent, but far, far
more intensely brilliant in the atmosphere, which
allows of little refraction, and whose purity makes an
upward gaze like the contemplation of some sanctified
enclosure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sitting on a bank that faced westward were observable
two human figures in the closing twilight of an
autumn day. They were gazing out upon the gorgeous
west, and marking the successful struggles of the
starry host to obtain visibility above. In all the rich
flush that marked the pathway of the sun, and hung a
glory around his place of exit, only one light had
strength enough to be visible; and so pure was the
atmosphere, that when the flush in the heavens retired,
the splendid planet Venus seemed a delicate crescent—a
diminutive moon, sinking downward to the western
waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How beautiful, dear Reuben,” said the young
female, as she pressed closely the hand of her companion;
“how beautiful the heavens above us are to-night.
It seems as if a peculiar brilliancy were observable;
and I hope it is not sinful for me to say that
the glorious array of stars seems to have communicated
to my bosom something of their own transparent
light; an unusual serenity seems to descend from them
to me, and I feel now as if I owed to them sensations
of inexpressible delight—quiet, gentle, but full. Whence
is this, Reuben?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May you not, my dear Miriam, have mistaken a
cause for an effect? Is it not the quiet, peaceful delight
of your heart that makes all outward objects more
lovely to you? And, as the stars are the most brilliant
and the most distant objects at the present moment,
your feelings have connected themselves with those
ministers of <span class='it'>Him</span>, and allowed that deep, mysterious
connection of the planetary world with ours to work
upon your imagination, as if the stars had a direct influence
upon your condition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps so; but I alluded to my feelings and not
my condition. How beautifully did our Prophet King
refer his own elevated sensations to the planetary
world, ‘The moon and the stars which <span class='sc'>Thou</span> hast
ordained.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, true, my dearest Miriam; but you will recollect
that while he made himself, and man generally,
small in his <span class='it'>contemplation</span> of the heavens, it was not
in <span class='it'>comparison</span> with them, it was comparing or contrasting
man with <span class='sc'>Him</span> who garnished the heavens,
and wrote ‘all our members in a book.’ But are not
your feelings, like mine, elevated with a hope, nay,
with almost a certainty, that the elders will persuade
my mother that the rights of our family can be retained,
even though I marry you, or rather that the argument
against our union was as unsustained by our laws as
the attempt to give you to Salathiel was a violation of
your affection and my rights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know not but that may be the case. I feel it,
Reuben, warmly at my heart. Let me say it without
violating the delicacy of a maiden’s feelings, that such
was my love for you, that even the alternative to which
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
I consented, though of no moment, gave me a severe
pang.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was that alternative?” asked the young
man, with importunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Simply, that if you should not live to marry me,
then Salathiel might take me to wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would haunt him with terrible bodings,” said
Reuben, “even as Samuel frightened the falling Saul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I, dear Reuben,” said the maiden, with a
smile, “should, I suppose, be the Witch of Endor to
call up your wandering and jealous spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it is settled, then,” said Reuben, “and you
are to be mine with the consent of our families. And
the next new moon shall see us one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shall be thus if your mother consents. I have
none to consent or refuse, save my aunt. But let it
not wound your feeling or excite suspicion in your
mind, Reuben, that I ask you not to cherish feelings
of unkindness against Salathiel. He is my kinsman
and my early friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he not sought to supplant me in your possession?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you not supplanted him in my heart? Is it
so much, my dear Reuben, for you to fear to lose me,
and is it nothing for him to see me given to another?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He tried for your possessions, Miriam, for your
wealth only.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does not my wealth, little as it is, go with my
hand—and why may not he have designs honorable
as well as others?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because he would not leave it to your decision, to
the arbitration of your affections. He could not love
you and be willing to do violence to your love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May he not, dear Reuben, say the same of you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of me! Miriam, you plead the cause of Salathiel.
You wish the alternative—you would be free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reuben, you may wound my pride by your injustice,
but you cannot make me cease to love you. You may
hereafter learn that woman may esteem a man for his
virtues without loving him as a husband; and that for
me to wish that you were less unkind to Salathiel, is
no evidence that I love you less. I have heard within
a few weeks such lessons of forgiveness, such preaching
of high virtues—high, though always practical—that
I desire to conform in some measure to them, and
to have him whom I love and respect, augment my
affection, not by any new <span class='it'>love</span> on his part, but by a
new exhibition of greatness of mind. Reuben, though
protracted maidenhood is a reproach in Israel, be assured
that my love is stronger than death—as I feel
that your jealousy is more cruel than the grave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not be jealous. I will forget what I have
deemed the wrongs of Salathiel. I will learn of you
to respect myself. But, Miriam, what teaching is that
to which you allude—what lessons of forgiveness have
you received, and from whom? Is not the law of
Moses sufficient for the daughters of Israel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose the laws of Moses are not sufficient, else
why have kings and prophets written and preached?
But you know that several times within a year the
teacher from Nazareth hath been in the synagogues of
Nain, and has, indeed, spoken in the houses of our relatives,
whither he hath come and broken bread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have heard of his visits, and that his teaching
had been eminently attractive—how <span class='it'>instructive</span>,”
continued Reuben, with a sneer, “how instructive
may be inferred from the proportion of women among
his immediate followers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There were more women than men, undoubtedly,
at his household instruction, because more women had
leisure to listen. But let me tell the truth, Reuben.
There <span class='it'>are</span> many women among his followers, for he
speaks to the heart of woman. He recognizes woman
as the equal of man in the necessity for salvation, and
he appeals to her affections, her experience, her wrongs
and her neglect. What other prophet has come among
us, that has thought it needful to recognize even his
descent from woman, while He of Nazareth soothes
our sorrows, elevates our hopes, and sanctifies our
human relations? As I listened of late to him when he
reproved but encouraged our sex, my heart said ‘this
teacher’s doctrines may <span class='it'>save</span> man,’ but how they
<span class='it'>elevate</span> and <span class='it'>purify</span> woman. And then the lessons
of love, of forbearance, of forgiveness, that he inculcates,
belong to what I have deemed woman’s nature
and man’s <span class='it'>necessity</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have followed the teacher, then, Miriam?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is a prophet, Reuben, and he attests his divine
mission by miracles. He has healed the sick, he has
cured the lame, and made the blind see and the deaf
hear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he raised the dead, as did the bones of Elisha?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have heard that he has wrought <span class='it'>that</span> miracle, but
do not know it, though I have such faith in his mission
as to believe he might.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>If he would raise me from the dead when I come
to die, I would have faith too!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think, Reuben, that this act would be the
consequence rather than the cause of faith. Though
many others believed, in Jerusalem, as my Cousin
Jacob says, in consequence of the restoration of blind
Bartemus to his sight, yet the Master said, ‘<span class='it'>Thy faith</span>
hath made thee whole!’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have, nevertheless, no faith in this teacher as a
prophet—why, whose son is he, Miriam?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is of the house of David, Reuben, and even
though his parents are poor, are they much poorer than
David’s parents? May there not be something in the
great truths which he teaches, that is not dependent
upon the parentage of the teacher?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These things are important, Miriam, I confess, and
we will confer of them together, but not now. We
are about to part, let us mark the separation by a recurrence
to a subject on which we both agree. The
next new moon sees us united, and my joy at the anticipation
is doubled by the belief that you share with
me in the pleasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miriam pressed the hand of her lover as they rose
to descend the hill; and as they entered the gate of
Nain, the rising moon poured its strong light through
the gorges of the mountain, the pair wended their way
through the broken streets of the city to the residence
of Miriam, blessed in their mutual affection, and refreshed
by the dry, cool breeze of evening, which had
fanned them on the elevated seat which they had just
left.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>
Reuben turned toward home with a resolution to
discuss the doctrine which he had heard imputed to the
new teacher. Miriam, with woman’s humility, “kept
all these things and pondered them in her heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miriam and Reuben met daily as espoused people;
and frequent allusions were made to the doctrines of
the teacher; and the pride of a Hebrew man was a little
touched at the evidences of the elevating effect of a
doctrine upon women, which Miriam’s language and
conduct presented. Yet Reuben loved her too well to
regret any circumstance which pleased and benefited
Miriam. The customs of the country were too well
fixed to lead him to fear the assumption of any inappropriate
position by his future wife; indeed, it is believed
that men do not begin to grow jealous of the
authority of women until after marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not find in the teaching of the new master,”
said Reuben, one day as they were conversing on the
subject now so important to her, and so generally interesting
to him, “I do not discover any denunciations
of our creed or our system and form of worship—why
may not his doctrines prevail without danger to the
Hierarchy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot guess of that, Reuben; but certainly the
teacher, while he refers to particular virtues and special
sins, seems to desire a purification of the motives. He
has conformed to all the requirements of our religion,
but seems at times to be above it. I wish I understood
him better. And yet how simple, how comprehensible
are all his teachings. Why should I seek to
know more? Why should I desire <a id='aught'></a>aught but that
which shall make me better—happier—more hopeful?
How the poor, the afflicted in body and in mind seek
him out, and sit in joy at his teaching.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miriam, I will hear him—I will hear him soon,”
said Reuben.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only a few days before the new moon that
Miriam had from the widow mother of Reuben an
intimation that her only son and heir was prostrated by
sudden and very severe sickness. The young woman
hastened across the town to be in attendance upon
Reuben, and to cheer him into health by her presence.
But when she reached the house, she learned rather by
the appearance than the words of the widow, that the
sickness of Reuben was not of a kind to yield to such
remedies as she had to offer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attention of Miriam to Reuben was all that her
feelings would permit her to give. She sat by his side
and bathed his temples, and moistened his feverish
hands, and listened with painful satisfaction to his unconscious
utterance of her name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the seventh day of Reuben’s sickness all awaited
the crisis, and a few hours before sunset he awakened
from a protracted sleep, and turned his eyes on the
hopeful countenance of Miriam. The members of the
family present saw with inexpressible pleasure that his
consciousness had returned, and they <span class='it'>hoped</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the physician pronounced against them. It was
but a restoration of mental light before the darkness of
death should set in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miriam,” said Reuben, “let me speak to thee alone
one moment”—and the family retired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am dying, and the truths which you announced
to me as we sat upon the hill-side some nights since—truths
which the new teacher uttered, come home with
strange distinctness to my heart. But is he, as his
disciples would have us believe—is he the Messiah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you believe it, dear Reuben?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know, but I forgive all who have injured
me, and I ask pardon of all whom I have injured.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely that is the spirit of the Master’s teaching,
Reuben, and what can you more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, oh, Miriam, where are the blessings which I
had promised myself in thy love? Where the years of
happiness in thy possession—when thou shouldst have
been only mine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are these regrets, my beloved, suited to one who
leans upon the verge of the grave? Oh, look forward,
Reuben, and look upward. In heaven we can meet
again—meet without fear of separation, without doubt
of love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But in heaven, where, oh, where shalt thou be,
Miriam?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reuben, dear Reuben?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, my beloved, let me show my affection for
you and my sense of duty to God at this last moment.
I know, my Miriam, that by the customs of our people
you should have been the wife of Salathiel, and I feel
that next to me, (I do your love no injustice, my betrothed,)
<span class='it'>next</span> to me, Salathiel has your affection. Hear
me out. When I am gone, it must be your duty. Oh,
then, let it be your pleasure to receive him. Who
better than he can be your protector? He is your
nearest kinsman, and the laws and customs of our
people are in his favor—promise me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reuben, shall I call in your mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reuben turned his eyes again toward the west, and
the sun was sinking with all his evening glory into the
great sea. A gentle breeze swept into the window,
and blew the hair of the kneeling maid upon the pale
face of her lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turn my face, Miriam, to the east, let me pray
thitherward. Let me hold you thus, ‘though the sorrows
of death compass me about⁠—’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the widowed mother entered the room the
dead form of her son was resting in the arms of the
unconscious Miriam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stricken with grief, and with a sense of her utter
loneliness, the widow lifted up her voice and wept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miriam was conveyed away—to be purified from the
legal uncleanness that results from contact with the dead.</p>

<hr class='tbk125'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was the morning of the third day from the death
of Reuben, and Miriam was sitting lonely in her
chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this,” said she, as she looked forth from her
darkened room, “this was the day appointed for our
marriage; and to-day they will take my beloved and
carry him forth from the city, and lay him in the earth
with his fathers; and his beautiful form shall moulder
into the dust, and the worms shall feed sweetly on
him. Yes, he shall return to the dust again, and his
spirit to God who gave it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Father,” said the
anguished maiden, as she kneeled with folded hands
and upturned, streaming eyes, “oh, Father, receive his
spirit!” And she poured out her soul in prayer for
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
the dead, “after the custom that is among the Jews,
even unto this day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly afterward the relatives of Miriam came in
to comfort her before they went to assist in the funeral
of Reuben. They respected her grief too much to
make open allusion to a subject which was occupying
their minds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the elders of the family, before going out, took
aside the afflicted girl and attempted to console her
with those cold arguments that interest suggests, and a
want of respect for woman’s position warrants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, Miriam,” continued the old man, after disregarding
her requests to be left alone, “still the possessions
of your father’s family remain with you; and
these may now, as they ought to have been before, be,
with you, the property of our Cousin Salathiel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, my Uncle Achan, you trouble me, indeed;
spare me that, let the possessions of our house go
whither you list, to yourself or to Salathiel, but let me
remain as I am. Give me peace—give me peace and
time for my tears, and I will endure the reproach of
maiden-widowhood, and let my name be lost from the
family of our fathers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Achan and his friends departed to meet at the house
of the widow, and to be of the company of those who
should assist in the funeral of her son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miriam sat in her chamber, looking forth from the
closed lattice to mark the first approach of the funeral-train
which would pass her aunt’s dwelling on its
way to the burying-place that lay beyond the walls of
the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The solemn train at length approached, and the cold,
insensible form of her lover lay upon a bier, wrapped
round with grave-clothes, and borne forth by men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she gazed down upon the appalling sight, her
heart seemed ready to burst with the grief that had no
utterance, and she fell insensible to the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Miriam opened her eyes, they rested upon the
forms of her aunt and of Salathiel bending over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was this well, Salathiel? Could you not have
spared me one day for grief, must my affections for
another be outraged, even in the presence of his
passing remains?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miriam, my cousin,” said Salathiel, “I came in
hither only to assist your aunt. No selfish feeling
brought me into your presence. I know where your
affections are, I know how deep-seated is your grief.
Let me rather, my Miriam, be to you a means of consolation,
than an occasion of offence, since my love to
your person is less than my sympathy in your grief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miriam placed her hand in that of Salathiel, and a
gentle pressure signified her appreciation of his feelings—and
such a sign, at such a moment, too, told him
how hopeless would be his love. He obeyed the sign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The funeral has passed on,” said she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is now near the gate of the city,” said Salathiel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall see it once more,” said Miriam, “as it
ascends the hill that overlooks the valley of tombs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that faith, Miriam,” asked her aunt, “of
which you spoke to me yesterday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is but confidence in the promises and power of
the teacher.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confidence that he will grant your wishes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, if they be right, or that if he grant them not,
then confidence that the refusal is best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you that confidence, Miriam?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh aunt, oh my mother, do not tempt me. I would
believe; my heart tells me that miracles such as his,
could only be performed to attest a momentous truth.
But do not tempt me, the body of Reuben is scarcely
passed, in him my heart, my affections, my hope were
centered—and he is taken from me. Why? is it good
for me to be afflicted?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could the Master have saved his life, my child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he not yesterday save the life of the Centurion’s
servant at Capernaum,” answered Salathiel,
struck with the coincidence of the woman’s question
with the recent fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ask him, Miriam?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw him not, and if I had seen him, what am I
to him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you had asked him, might he not have done it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe, aunt; I believe, Salathiel, that he <span class='it'>could</span>
have saved the life of Reuben.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would he not, then, raise him now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do believe he <span class='it'>could</span>—I have faith in his <span class='it'>power</span>.
But I would not be presumptuous. Yet, yet—oh, that
Reuben might be restored to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amen!” said Salathiel, “Amen!” and the deep
tone of voice, and the upward turn of his eyes, told
how truly his heart responded to the prayer of his
cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two hearts were then united in solemn petition.
There was <span class='it'>faith</span>, but none thought of <span class='it'>hope</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a few minutes of solemn silence, the eyes of
Miriam were turned mournfully, and yet eagerly, toward
the hill beyond the city’s wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are passing upward,” said Deborah to her;
“the procession moves toward the brow of the hill, but,
alas! the dust of the road conceals the train.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all looked forth to follow with their eyes as
long as possible the mournful procession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what is there?” exclaimed Deborah, pointing
to a column of dust which denoted a crowd of people
descending the hill toward the funeral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The procession has passed,” said Miriam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Both parties have stopped,” exclaimed Deborah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Salathiel looked earnestly out and said, in a low
voice, but with much feeling, “Do the Romans come
to insult us even when we bury our dead? We are a
<span class='it'>conquered</span> people, but we are not <span class='it'>slaves</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” said Miriam, “hush, my brother! let us
not at this moment forget the teaching of the Master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Salathiel leaned forward and kissed the brow of
Miriam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank you, I thank you, Miriam, for the monition,
and I bless you for the term, brother; henceforth, my
sister, know me for such. But let me go forth to learn
what hath turned our people from their sepulchral
rites.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Salathiel went forth, and Miriam, kneeling, buried
her face in the lap of her aunt, and poured out her soul
in prayer—deep, anguished, heart-engendered, heart-and-heaven-moving
prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was some time before the low voice of Miriam
ceased. But her feelings had been overwrought, and
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
at length she lay silent yet suffering, with her head still
on Deborah’s knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The quiet of the street and even of the chamber was
at length disturbed by the confused footfall of a multitude
who seemed to press onward with few words,
and those uttered in a subdued tone. The multitude
at length paused in front of the dwelling of Miriam, and
the opening of the front door intimated that the procession
of the people had some connection with the
inmates of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door of Miriam’s chamber at length opened, and
Salathiel stood before the two women pale and agitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My sister, praise the Lord! A miracle has been
wrought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The agitated maiden shrunk into the arms of her
aunt as she gazed toward Salathiel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What,” exclaimed the aunt, “what is it, Salathiel?
Speak?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reuben—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reuben!” exclaimed Miriam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reuben lives!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where—where is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has been borne back to the house of his mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How has this been wrought?” asked Deborah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is our Cousin Asher, who was a witness of
the whole. Shall he come in and tell you all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Asher was admitted with one or two others of the
family, and briefly stated the facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The rear of the very long procession that followed
the corpse of Reuben had scarcely left the gate of the
city, when I, who was assisting to bear the bier upon
which rested the beloved remains, discovered a vast
crowd of people coming down the hill. I soon, however,
perceived that there was no intention on the part
of the approaching mass to offer any offence or discourtesy
to the funeral party; and, indeed, the expressions
of grief by our widowed and bereaved kinswoman
were so loud, that it was difficult to hear whether any
word was uttered by the descending party. I have
never seen a Hebrew woman so distressed; and though
few have had such cause for grief, few have been
more deeply wounded, yet I had hoped that she would
have been able to repress her feelings. But as we
grew nearer the grave, her lamentations were increased,
and it was heart-rending to hear her exclamations. The
whole procession seemed to have lost their own sense
of bereavement in the presence of one the utterance of
whose anguish was so impressive. To me it seemed
almost an arraignment of Providence by our kinswoman.
I cannot tell you how every one was affected;
each seemed to wish silently but heartily that some
event might occur to soothe the sorrows of the
widow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At length the descending party, which was very
large, met our procession; and almost every member
of that company manifested deep sympathy for the
suffering of the chief mourner. In a moment the principal
of the company stepped forward and took our
kinswoman by the hand, and whispered to her words
of comfort. What they were I could not hear, but
the effect was instantaneous—the clamor of grief was
hushed—and our kinswoman walked quietly on, gazing
with a sort of <a id='rapt'></a>rapt awe upon the comforter, whose
countenance though marked with sympathy for her
suffering was yet majestic and dignified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mother’s eyes for a moment wandered from
the face of the visiter, and fell upon the form of her
son stretched out before her, and again her agony
found vent—again the <span class='it'>mother</span> was heard, again the
mountain seemed to echo with her lamentation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He who was walking at her side did not rebuke
the mourner, but a new and more intent feeling of
compassion was evident in his look and manner, and
taking the hand of the afflicted one, he said in a tone
of deep consolation, ‘<span class='sc'>Weep not</span>.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Almost immediately afterward he left the widow
standing where she was, and approaching us ‘came
and touched the bier,’ and we who were carrying it
stopped; for there was a sort of authority in the air
and movement of this person, or let me say the effect
rather than the assumption of authority. When the
eyes of all were turned toward the dead body, and toward
him that stood by it, the person with a mild tone,
with no ceremony, with a simple utterance of the
words, said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<span class='it'>Young man, I say unto thee, Arise!</span>’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Reuben, dear Asher, Reuben!” exclaimed
Miriam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Reuben sat up on the bier, and began to speak
of the sensations which crowded upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But He who had restored him to life, seemed to
comprehend that the mother’s feelings should be first
consulted, her rights first respected, and so ‘<span class='it'>He</span> delivered
him to his mother.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he lives now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes now, and with his mother. But what an awe
came upon those who witnessed that august scene.
There was no shouting at the success of the effort, no
cheering that human life had been restored. But with
an overpowering sense of divine visitation, the people,
in devout fear, kneeled, and ‘glorified God,’ saying ‘a
prophet has risen up among us.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not deemed safe to the convalescent Reuben
that Miriam should visit him immediately. His life
not his health had been restored. And the effect of a
too early interview, might be too much for both. A
few days afterward Salathiel conducted Miriam to the
house of Reuben, and as they proceeded thither he
cautioned her against the indulgence of too much feeling,
lest her own frame should yield. Leading her to
the door of the chamber, the young man felt that his
presence would be too much of a restraint, so knocking
lightly he heard a voice from within bidding them
enter, and he turned and went to the mother in another
part of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was said by the young lovers, separated as
they had been by death, and thus restored this side the
grave, we shall not now repeat. It was a sublime
colloquy, for it included the experience of a heart in
which hope had contended against hope—and the awful
experience of a soul that had been freed from the
trammels of flesh. But it was still Reuben and Miriam.
Death had not destroyed the identity, for the
same love that had animated them in his former life
was felt and reciprocated now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did fear, Reuben; indeed, for a moment I feared,
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
when I heard of your restoration, that the love which
had been a part of <span class='it'>our</span> lives, would have been quenched
in you by death, or sublimated beyond the uses and
comprehension of earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Miriam love is the immortal part of our affections—it
is the soul of the mind—it is stronger than
death—and that which is pure and rightly placed on
earth is indestructible, and thousands of years, my beloved,
passed in separation would work no change.
We should at our renewed communion find the same
love that had existed in past centuries in full and satisfactory
operation. You know that the seeds which
our travelers bring from the mummies of Egypt are as
fruitful as those which are sown from the last year’s
harvest, so, my beloved one, is the love that is worthy
the soul’s cherishing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Reuben, has it struck you that you have received
the testimony which you almost impiously
challenged as a ground of faith?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has, it has, and while I have been struck with
shame at the impiety of such a thought, I have yielded
the faith which I promised, and am henceforth a
follower of the teachings of Him of Nazareth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my prayers, dear Reuben⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were pure, and effective to <span class='it'>your</span> good, Miriam,
undoubtedly, but it was from compassion for my
widowed, childless mother that the miracle was
wrought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who shall tell the motives of Him that can work
miracles? What we call ends, dear Reuben, may be
means with him, and the babe that is sent in answer to
the Hebrew mother’s prayer, may be the saviour or
the destroyer of his people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Salathiel then knocked for admittance. He entered
and kissing both of his cousins he wept with joy—“And
this, this is the consummation of my highest
earthly wish,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it indeed? Can <span class='it'>you</span> rejoice, Salathiel, that I am
come to take Miriam from you; is it indeed thus, my
cousin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have loved Miriam as dearly as you could love
her, Reuben. I will yield in that to none. I will not
affect to conceal <span class='it'>that</span>. But the miracle that has raised
you to life has shown me that I have a higher duty to
perform, a more glorious mission to fulfill. Be yours,
my cousin, the enjoyment of domestic love and peace
and happiness, which virtue ensures; and let your
home and your lives illustrate the power of the Master’s
doctrine to purify and multiply home affections.
Henceforth, if permitted, I will sit at the feet of the
teacher and learn; and when <span class='it'>sent</span> I will go, and offer
his doctrines and my life for the good of our people.”</p>

<hr class='tbk126'/>

<p class='pindent'>The new moon had again come, and the house of
the aunt of Miriam was filled with her kinspeople,
who had come to the marriage; and when the feast
was over, and parties had formed in different rooms,
and some, with the bride and bridegroom, were on the
housetop enjoying the delightful air of evening, as it
swept down the hills loaded with the scents of roses
and acacia, some drew the attention of the party to the
brilliancy of the slender moon in the west, and the
stars that were scattered through the heavens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a good omen,” said Asher, “when the planet
that is so near the moon assumes with her the crescent
shape at a marriage, or when at this season the Pleiads
and Orion are peculiarly brilliant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The newly married ones looked up smilingly toward
the heavens, as if they recognized the doctrine of stellar
influences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Salathiel, who had been looking upon the pair with
deep interest, then stepped forward, and taking a hand
of each, he said, “My cousins, I am called away—not
again to mingle in this delightful scene—called to a
higher duty; pray that it may be as delightful—it cannot
be more dangerous. Keep the faith—mark the
signs of the times in the conduct of man and in the instigations
of your passions, but look not to the stars for
your instruction. Oh, my beloved one,” and he stooped
and kissed the lips of Miriam, “oh, my dear brother,”
and he pressed his lips to the forehead of her husband;
“oh, Reuben and Miriam, ‘seek Him that maketh the
Seven Stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death

<p class='pindent'>The school was dismissed, and a multitude of boys
and girls came rushing out from the old frame building,
and tore pell-mell down the streets of a country village,
just like merry, care-naught mad-caps as they were.
Of all ages and sizes were these little folks—they were
the life and the care of a great many homes; some
heirs of poverty, and some, but these were few, heirs
of wealth—but each and all had brought with them
into the world enough of love to secure for themselves
a welcome place at the board, and by the hearth.
They resembled very much any other congregation of
children in the world—some of them remarkable for
their stupidity, and presenting always to their teachers
the same thick skulls, which it appeared nothing could
penetrate—others again, quick at learning, to whom it
was a relief for the weary Mentors to turn, and to
whose mental wants they attended with a glad alacrity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I am not going to generalize any more at this
time; and shall only add to the foregoing remarks, that
this school was a marvel in its way—the teachers
prodigies in learning, and all the parents thought their
young children’s acquirements actually verging on to
the miraculous—which state of things, I will add as a
P. S., is remarkably pleasant for all parties concerned.
Is it not teachers, and parents, and you poor little
scholars?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several girls, from nine to twelve years of age, were
walking homeward leisurely, and talking loudly and
earnestly on some important topic, as school-girls
sometimes will, when a young boy, also one of the
scholars, passed by them. With singular boldness he
turned his handsome face full toward the little party as
he passed, and one of the girls, whose name was Grace
Germain, must have seen something remarkably expressive
of somewhat in the boy’s black eyes, for very
suddenly she seemed to have lost all interest in the
conversation, in which, by the way, she had been one
of the chief participators the moment before—and the
little girl’s step grew slower and slower. Finally,
taking one of her school-books from under her arm,
Grace seemed all at once to be seized with a decidedly
studious fit, (for the first time that week,) and then her
shoe-strings must needs unloosen, and she must stop
to fasten them, till at last, as might be expected, her
companions were far beyond her in the homeward
way, and she was left quite alone. When the child
passed by a little lane her face became quite suddenly
and unaccountably flushed, and Grace grew decidedly
nervous in her movements, and she turned away her
head, as though it were forbidden, and a sin for her to
look down that narrow by-way where Dame Corkins
and the little lame child lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But these mysterious movements were all explained
when, a moment after, some one came marching, to a
tune of double-quick time, up the lane, and when he
appeared on the main-street again, lo and behold! it
was that same black-eyed urchin Hugh Willson, who
had a few moments previous passed by her, and he
called out,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grace, Grace Germain, wait a moment; I want to
tell you something!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace of course blushed, and looked sideways, and
down, and finally at the boy, but for the life of her she
could not summon up a look of astonishment at his
appearance, finally she said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what do you want, Hugh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going home, Grace, to-morrow, and—and—I
wanted to see you just to give you this; perhaps you’ll
think I’m a fool for my pains. I wish though it was
worth its weight in gold!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! you would have certainly thought that the poor
girl’s face was on the point of blazing instantly, could
you have seen it, and Hugh thought there were really
tears in her eyes too, as she put out her hand for the
little package he had brought her. For some distance
they walked on together, and neither spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, as she drew near home, Grace found
courage to look up and say, “Hugh, what are you going
home for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father has sent for me, I am to go to an academy,
but—” Hugh did not finish the sentence, and after
waiting an unconscionable time, and speaking at last
as though a “drag” were fastened to every word,
Grace said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will come to see us again sometime, wont you,
Hugh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, if I ever can. I can’t bear to go away now,
Grace, but, as father says, I <span class='it'>am</span> getting old. I’m
almost fifteen, and it’s a fact I ought to know more
than I do. Perhaps I’ve staid in the country too long
already; but I hate a city, and I shall come back here
just as often as I can, for I love this place better than
all the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that, reader, was rather a strange confession to
be made by a spirit so active and stirring as was Hugh
Willson’s, for of all country villages on the face of the
earth, “Romulus” was certainly the dullest, and least
attractive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m coming down by here to-night, Grace,” said
the lad, as he opened the gate for the child, “if you
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
would like to see me, come out here—I cannot bid
you good-bye now—will you be here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Hugh,” was the reply given sadly—and this
time it was a great deal more than she could do to
keep back or hide her tears—for Grace Germain
thought Hugh Willson the handsomest and kindest boy
she ever knew, and she could not bear to think of his
going away. So she left him with little ceremony,
and went into the house. And the boy saw her grief,
and he could have wept also—he <span class='it'>loved</span> Grace Germain!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, what do you think made up that unpretending
package—the parting gift? First and foremost, there
was a little box, and it contained—not a gem, not a
book, but—a fresh, beautiful rose-bud; and Grace did
not laugh when she saw it, neither did she smile as
she unwound the strip of paper from the stem, and
read thereon,</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not laugh, I say, for sorrow was in her heart,
the first deep sorrow she had ever known. Hugh was
going away—and how much better she liked him than
all other boys she had ever known in her life! But
the rose-bud was not all the contents of the box; there
was beside it a magnificent sheet of blue paper, gilt
edged, and “superfine,” and on it Hugh had copied the
“Parting Song,” by Mrs. Hemans; and perhaps, good
reader, though you be not fresh from Yankee land, you
may guess how the child’s heart beat faster than ever
it had before, as she read the words—</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what had Grace to give to Hugh? What had
she among her few treasured possessions a <span class='it'>boy</span> would
care for? The dolls maimed for life—the broken
china—the picture-books—the bits of lace and ribbons,
what were they to him? Grace never realized her
poverty before that day—and then the very thought
was humiliating. If she could only buy a knife,
or a pocket-book, or a pencil-case; but the child
had no purse, and, unfortunately, no money either, so
that thought was speedily abandoned. It grew quite
dark while she stood in her little room, still before the
opened drawer which held all her keepsakes and
treasures, but no good fairy was nigh at hand to lay before
her the thing she wished, and at last, quite in despair,
she went and stood by the parlor window, and
lo, there was Hugh already passing by, whistling, and
looking for all the world as though the inmates of that
particular house were nothing in the least to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few moments, side by side, the boy and girl
were walking in the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have read your note, Hugh,” said Grace, for the
“shades of evening” creeping over them, gave her a
wonderful and unnatural boldness to speak, “but what
shall I give you for a keepsake? I haven’t a book in
the world <span class='it'>you</span> would give a fig for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t talk about books,” replied he, hastily, “there
is something that wouldn’t cost you much, I’d give
more for than for all the books in Christendom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Hugh, tell me quick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just that curl on your forehead! Give me that,
Grace, and I never will part with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment it was separated from the thick curls
that adorned her head, and stooping down, Grace laid
a forget-me-not in it, and gave it to Hugh. He—what?
kissed it, and kissed Grace, and then put the curls safely
in his vest-pocket, and told the child she was the prettiest
and best girl he ever knew, and that he should
miss her more than all the boys and girls of the village
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But while the lad was in the very midst of his ardent
protestations, a voice from the house called to Grace,
and the children parted—to meet again, how and
when you shall not be so long learning as they were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hugh went to his city home, Grace to her school.
He dreaming of Grace Germain as a woman, and
wondering if she would not then be his wife—she to
resume her studies with no great interest, to wish day
after day that Hugh would only come back again, and
to wonder if he would be so handsome when he was a
man as he was then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Years passed, Grace was no longer a child but a
beautiful girl—a bride; and yet Hugh Willson was not
her bridegroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rich young merchant of a neighboring town, captivated
by her loveliness and charming manners, had
“wooed an won,” and a nine days’ wonder in the village
of Romulus, was the wonderful good fortune of the
orphan—for of late years Grace had been dependent
on her relatives, her parents having died while she
was yet very young.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace had never seen or heard of the boy of rose-bud
memory since their first parting, but her thoughts
of him had always been those we have for a pleasant
unforgotten dream. And she kept the little gift that
Hugh had given her most religiously. The very night
before her bridal, though she had wept happy tears
over the noble, tender note that Clarence Lovering
sent her with a splendid ornament—a wedding-gift—still
she had it in her heart even then, to look with no
ordinary interest on the little pasteboard box that held
the withered flower, and to read, not carelessly, the
verses Hugh had written her in a large, boyish hand
so long ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet it was not faithlessness to later vows that
prompted her to kiss the rose-bud, and to preserve still
longer the blue note and the little box, for Grace with
all her heart respected Clarence Lovering, and she
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
loved him well, too. She was a lofty, true-spirited
girl, and when she married the young merchant, for
better or for worse, as it might prove, she did it with
a true and loyal heart; and it was in all respects a
union in which might well be asked, and without doubt
or fear, the blessing of Heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there were bitterer tears to be shed, and deeper
griefs to be borne than Grace Lovering had yet known;
six months after her marriage she followed her young
husband to the grave, and there was none on earth
that could sustain or uphold her in that day of terrible
visitation. Voices and forms with which she was
scarcely familiar came to comfort her, but the friend
whose companionship would have made any place in
the wide world a pleasant home for her, was dead;
and the bereaved woman longed to return once again
to her early home—the village where all her early
life was passed—to bury her husband and lover beside
her parents, under the willow-tree in the old burial-ground,
and then to mourn in quietness, and alone,
away from the scenes of the bustling, noisy town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And all her desires were speedily complied with—her
old guardian and uncle from the little village came
to her to assist, and conduct her back to Romulus;
and before the year was passed, Grace was again at
home in the old house where she was born, and in the
grave-yard near by, on which she could daily, hourly
look, her husband slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kindly and tenderly the old neighbors welcomed
back the mourner to their midst; and there, where in
her childish heart love had first awakened, there,
where in later years she had watched in agony the
dear ones of the household “passing away” silently
into the “silent land;” there, in the old dwelling,
which, during the few past years had stood tenantless,
and looking so broken-hearted; there, in her early
womanhood, Grace Lovering, the desolate and stricken,
came back to make it her abiding-place, her lonely
<span class='it'>home</span>. She felt that to her a cold twilight of existence
only was remaining, that the sunshine which rests so
richly and revivingly on the young and the beloved,
would be henceforth faint and weak as her own heart.
But it was not wholly so, time the great soother, as
well as destroyer and chastener, took the sting and the
poignancy from her grief, and, like the dove with its
olive branch, there spread through her soul that trust
in Heaven’s infinite goodness, that makes the wilderness
even to blossom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Placed far above the reach of poverty, the miseries
and cares of want did not mingle their bitterness with
her heart-sorrow. And in all, save those few natural
but dread experiences, Grace bade fair to be a “babe
at seventy,” in that unwelcome wisdom which continued
misfortunes only can impart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was her thirtieth birth-day, and the anniversary of
her marriage. The widow sat alone in the pleasant
parlor of her cottage; she had remained alone that day,
and with tears dedicated it to her heart’s sacred memories.
Every thing about the room and the house,
was pleasantly indicative of a refined and peaceful way
of living, and of cheerfulness, too, save and except the
sorrowing woman, who, at nightfall paced the room,
and looked so sadly into the past. The curtains of the
windows were drawn and the door closed; Grace had
been looking again over the treasures of her casket.
It was in that very room, twenty years before, she
had laid down on that night of their parting, to dream
about Hugh Willson, and to pray for his happiness; and
now she stood there a widow, sad and desolate, in her
prime of life, thinking of the love of her later life—and
weeping as she thought—for Clarence Lovering was
worthy to be so remembered and loved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the beautiful casket, <span class='it'>his</span> gift, were laid the bridal
ornaments which he had given; she had never worn
them since his death, but kept them where no eye but
her own could gaze upon them, and think of his loving
kindness, but with them was preserved still a withered
flower whose fragrance had fled quite away, and <span class='it'>never</span>
with a heart quite calm, had Grace been able to look
upon it; neither had she ever been able to think with
indifference, or a mere <span class='it'>idle</span> curiosity of thought, on the
probable worth of Hugh Willson’s manhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, as the night came on, the letters, and the
jewels, and the rose, were laid away, but the miniature
of her lost husband was lying next her heart then—for
the love of the woman was vaster and deeper than
that of the child; and Grace had dried her tears, for
the hope that consoles the Christian mourner had conquered
the agony of spirit that for a time overwhelmed
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evening proved dark and stormy, the pattering
of the rain upon the window-sill, and the still softer
and more dream-like sound with which it falls upon
the grass, which is so pleasant to hear when all within
the house is bright and cheerful, was a melancholy
sound to the lonely woman, for it fell upon the graves
in the burial-ground, where the damp earth was the
only shelter of her beloved ones, and its echo fell upon
that grave in her heart where lay buried the hopes of
her youth—she might have, and I know not but she
did, draw from it a hope and a promise of resurrection
and of life both for her lamented dead, and for her
vanished joy in life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The quiet of the chamber was for a moment broken,
a servant entered, a letter laid upon the table, and then
the door was closed, the post-boy gone, and all was
still again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mechanically the widow tore off the envelope, and
opened the epistle. Let us read it with her, for Grace
Lovering is born to a new life when those contents
are made known to her—she dwells no longer in the
so lonely present, or the sad past. For her also the
future is alive again. She did not look for a resurrection
so sudden and so strange—did you?</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Grace, dear Grace Germain, from the sands of the
desert my voice, perhaps long, long forgotten, comes
to you again. It is night, ‘night in Arabia,’ and I am
for a moment alone; my traveling companions are gone
to their rest, but I—I cannot sleep, and so have come
from out my tent to write by the light of the burning
stars once again to her who <span class='it'>was</span> the little girl I knew
and loved in childhood. You may think my man’s
estate has been reached unworthily, because I still love
to think of boyish hours, and long so to recall them—yes,
that is it, <span class='it'>long to recall them</span>. Are you yourself
unable to think of them as the very blessedest days
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
you ever knew? If it is so, Grace, how idly will my
words fall on your ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know nothing of what has been the fate of the child
I loved so well. I know not if you are the bride of
another, or, perchance, I may be addressing myself to
one who no longer has a name on the earth; but even
if the idol of my boyish years is living for, and to another,
I can pray for and bless her. Yes, I pray God
to bless you, Grace Germain. I cannot and will not
believe that the <span class='it'>woman</span> to whom I address myself, is
no more. There is something whispering to my spirit
now, it is not so. I feel to-night a strong conviction,
an irresistible presentiment that you and I will meet
again. I dare not think <span class='it'>how</span>, but this I know, if it is
not in this world, we shall know one another hereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you remember me at all, I know it is only as the
wild and trifling boy who loved you better than his
books, better than all children he ever knew. You
know me not at all as the stern, time-tried, care-worn
man, who has fought fierce battles with fortune and
life, who finds himself wasting the powers of his manhood,
far severed from all domestic, humanizing ties,
treasuring in his heart only one name that makes the
joyful recollection of his youth—careless, cold, and
selfish perhaps, but never losing hold of that one, dear
link to the affection, the lasting, undying affection that
was born of you in my youthful soul, and still, still
preserves its strength <span class='it'>through</span> you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps, indeed, you do not in the faintest degree
remember me. You may have to recall with an effort
the time of childhood, or at least that time when I was
your school-companion; nay, it may be an effort for
you to recall my name. Oh, if that is the truth, how
very different is it to the memory I have treasured of
you, dear Grace. My home has been upon the oceans
and in the deserts, and mid the wilds of nature every
where. Many years have passed since I left my
father’s house, and my feet have never from that time
touched upon my native shores. During these years
of absence I have had opportunities to try my heart.
I have learned who are the friends most dear to me,
and over the vast sea of the desert sand, across the
great ocean, let my voice come and whisper in your
ear, Grace, there are none, none whose memory is so
treasured now as is your own! The longing which is
so often felt by the wanderer for the scenes and familiar
faces of his native land, has never before pressed so
heavily on me as this night; and now I wish, oh, how
eagerly, to revisit, if it be only for an hour, that quiet
place where a portion of my school-life was passed;
and yet it is only because it is, or may be still <span class='it'>your</span>
home; and were I there again, I might tread with <span class='it'>you</span>
along the race-course, and over the old bridge to
—— Grove, and through all the haunts now treasured
in my memory. Do you remember the gifts we gave
at parting? and did you fling away the bud as a worthless,
trifling thing, even before it was faded? Or—what
madness, you will think, prompted such an idea—do
you keep it still? Perhaps you had not then so fully
awakened to the life of the heart, you may not have
dreamed that with that simple memento I gave to you the
dreams of my boyhood, the hopes of my youth. Grace,
I gave you <span style='font-size:smaller'>MY HEART</span> with the flower. I have never
since recalled it. And now, if memories are returning
again to you, if you are looking half tremblingly into
the past, you will think of the little curl and the frail
forget-me-not. Oh, you will not need that I should
tell now how in danger and in suffering, and through
all the most varied experiences I have preserved them—and
how I have <span class='it'>not</span> forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Last night I dreamed that you kept the rose-bud
yet, and, will you believe it, when I awakened, and
recalled to mind the proverb about the truthfulness of
dreams, and their <span class='it'>contrariness</span>, it troubled me. Thousands
of miles lie between us, and we may never
meet again, all recollections of my native land save
those relating to you only, are hateful to me; but,
could I only hear your voice assuring me this night,
or could I believe that you would welcome me back,
and say to me with your own sweet voice that you
were glad to see me, oh, I should run and could not
weary nor grow faint, and neither day nor night should
look upon my lagging feet until I stood once more
beside you. Thou, beautiful joy of my childhood, say,
wouldst thou welcome me?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you will think I have taken an unwarrantable
liberty in so addressing you, for the friendships
and loves of children are, I know, usually evanescent
as dreams, yet I cannot, will not, think that whatever
may be your position in life now, or whatever may be
the relations you sustain in life, I do not believe that
you will scorn me for the words I have written, or
that you will read carelessly this record of my thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Time has dealt with no light hand to me, he may
have given you, perhaps, with every passing year, a
blessing. He has laid no caressing arm on me; possibly
he has guided you thus far tenderly as a mother
would lead her child. I have bowed beneath his
frown, and you, you may have grown to glorious perfectness
in the light of his smile. I have known deep
sorrows—it may be, oh, I pray it may <span class='it'>not</span> be—that
you also have not escaped the universal heritage. It
might be far beyond your possibility to recognize in
<span class='it'>me</span> the bright boy filled with glad expectations that you
once knew; but I cannot but believe that I should
know you, and recognize you amid a multitude—the
mild and beautiful blue eyes—the meek, gentle, and
so expressive countenance—the smile, so sweet and
winning, that rested so often on the face of the dear
child; oh, they are not yet forgotten. I am convinced
the <span class='it'>woman</span> whom I love has a face whose expression
is heavenly! Do not censure me, I pray, for daring
to <span class='it'>tell</span> my love. The hope of being with you once
again, and of speaking with and looking upon you, is
like the hope of heaven to the pilgrim, weary and out-worn
with earth-striving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Months will pass away before these words, uttered
from the fullness of my heart, reach you—the heart
from which they come may have ere then ceased its
beating, may be cold and dead; but will it be nothing for
you to know that its beatings were ever true to you,
even though you never have, and do not now need my
homage? Will you care to think that when I wrote
these words it was my highest hope that I might one
day follow them to the home of Grace Germain, to
beseech at least her friendliness, to hear the tones of
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
her dear voice again, and then perhaps to lie down to
rest in the grave-yard near her home, where it would
be no wrong for her to come sometimes, even from a
circle of beloved ones, to think of days gone by, the
days of merry childhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have written too much—too much; the day is
dawning, we shall journey far through the desert before
to-morrow morning, but to-night, with every word I
have written, thoughts and great hopes have awakened
which will never be stilled again—they will be with me
till I stand once more before you; and if there be a
dearer one on whom your eyes will rest as you lift
them from this page, to whom you will confide this
folly of an old man, as you perhaps will call it, yet still
remember me, and let him think of me with forgiving
kindness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May the rich blessing of heaven be with you now
and ever.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“<span class='sc'>Hugh Willson.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And had Hugh Willson, indeed, committed an unpardonable
trespass in writing thus, after the lapse of
so many years, to his old schoolmate? No, no! bear
witness the sudden flashings of color, and the as sudden
paleness which swept over the lady’s face as she
read on; bear witness the occasional smiles, and the
long and passionate weeping in which the lonely woman
indulged, when her eyes rested so tenderly and
sadly on the name affixed to the strange epistle. They
were not tears of anger that she shed; it was not a
smile of derision and mockery, at the sudden betrayal
of affection the man had given, after a silence of years;
they were not words of scorn which escaped her lips
when she laid down to rest that night; ah, no! he had
powerfully touched a chord in her soul, that from her
childhood had ever vibrated even at the mention of his
name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were eyes that were not closed in sleep during
the hours of that night—but it was not grief that caused
the widow’s wakefulness. There was one who
listened till the morning to the heavy falling rain—but
not in sadness; there was a lady who arose when the
sunlight streamed once more through her chamber, who
looked out on the blue heavens whence all the clouds
had vanished, and hailed then a new era in her life-history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that day there was a marked change in the
existence of Grace Lovering. That message of love
which had come to her from the desert, at a time when
life pressed heavily upon her, and death seemed the
only hope of relief; that message aroused and cheered
her, and made her to look more thankfully on the life
yet vouchsafed to her, and the blessings which had
been given along with the sorrows. Though the hope,
and the thought even, seemed a wild one, that Hugh
Willson would ever again return, the idea that he even
remembered her, and thought still with interest on
their childish years was grateful to her heart, and made
her feel that neither for her nor for any one in the
wide world is life <span class='it'>utterly</span> lonely and worthless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>True, the widowed and orphaned woman never
forgot that she had <span class='it'>buried her dead</span>, that all her nearest
of kin slept the long and quiet death-sleep; but a serenity
and cheerfulness quite usurped the past frequent
melancholy, and smiles were oftener seen upon her
lovely face than tears. And not only in herself was
the change visible; her household, and the little cottage
seemed to share in the awakened happiness; and then,
too, the poor and the needy had oftener cause to bless the
widowed woman. The sick and suffering shared her
loving care; and they blessed her—well might they—when
she stood so often like a ministering angel beside
them. The old and the weary mingled her name in
their thanksgiving, for she failed not to make their
downward path easy, and her voice was the voice of
a comforter to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this, as it were, instantaneous rousing up to
active life, was a blessed thing for Grace. Time, after
that great change, sped on no leaden wing; the clouds
began to break, and stars came out, even when she
had thought nothing but midnight darkness was forever
her portion. The heart of the widow grew strong
then, for she knew that when those stars were set, or
hid again as they <span class='it'>had</span> been from her eyes, that the
great sun itself would arise, and the never-ending daylight
would break for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten years thus passed away. The shadows of forty
winters had crept over the wife of Clarence Lovering;
and still she wore the garments of mourning, in remembrance
of the husband of her youth; but it was not a
repining, murmuring spirit that dwelt beneath those
doleful robes.</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>and she dwelt on the earth blessing and blest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many times her hand had been sought in marriage;
strong-willed men had bowed themselves, and sued
humbly for her love—but she had none to give, and no
prospect of increased <a id='world'></a>worldly prosperity could influence
her to utter with less of truthfulness and honesty of
soul than she had once spoken them, the marriage
vows!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace had her treasures still, and there was an unfinished
romance connected with her life, of which I
would not say she did not at times long to know the
conclusion—for she felt it was not concluded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were gray hairs—only a very few, my gentle
reader—visible among the beautiful brown locks, and
the clustering curls Hugh Willson treasured the memory
of so well, were all vanished; there was no bloom
upon the pleasant face—the blue eyes were less bright—but
the “features of the soul” remained unchanged,
or if at all changed, only in their nearer approach to
perfection. And amid her kindly charities, and the
thousand love-inspired duties had Grace forgotten the
letter ten years old, and its author! Very far from that;
and it had been a source of happiness deeper than she
cared to acknowledge even to herself, to look once
again on Hugh Willson, and to hear his voice. But
none save that one letter had ever reached her from
him; he might have forgotten, though that to her
seemed a thing impossible. The depths of feeling revealed
in that letter <span class='it'>might</span> have existed no longer, or
at least might have ceased to bear <span class='it'>her</span> reflection and
image, when he had fully exposed it to the light. He
might be dead!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once or twice she harbored the wild idea of answering
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>
his letter, to bid him come back—to assure
him that there was at least one who would most
heartily welcome him; and at such times Grace could
but smile at her own folly—for the wanderer had no
settled home, and there was no possibility of knowing
where, even for a moment, his abiding place was; and
so her natural good sense dispatched that fancy with a
multitude of others to the land of shadows and dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came round in the natural order of things a
sacrament Sabbath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was one of those heavenly days in the month of
all months, that is, the “month of roses,” when,</p>

          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And over it softly her warm ear lays;</p>
<p class='line0'>Whether we look or whether we listen,</p>
<p class='line0'>We hear life murmur, and see it glisten!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Every clod feels a stir of might,</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus describes Lowell one of those “perfect days”
I am speaking of. (And, by the way, have you yet
read that, the most exquisite poem produced in these
latter days? If you have not, I prithee leave my
romance unfinished, and inflict whatever other penance
on yourself you may deem proper for neglecting so
long that “gem of the first water,” whether regarded
as a <span class='it'>luxuriously printed</span> book, or as a poem beyond
all praise or—criticism!)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, it was on a Sabbath in June, as I began to tell
you when the remembrance of “Sir Launfal” startled
me from my story-telling proprieties; the windows
of the little church were opened wide, and doubtless
troops of invisible angels had entered in, to see how
the congregation would commemorate His death—and
probably the assembly had a faint idea of this, for
solemn was the expression of every face, and reverent
and humble every voice, that joined in the so beautiful
and appropriate responses of the liturgy of “dear mother
church!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one of the slips nearest the door, a stranger had
seated himself shortly after the opening of the service;
though his voice joined with those of the congregation
in the supplications and thanksgivings, he seemed at
times to be lost in other thoughts than those which
<span class='it'>should</span> fill the minds of them who gather themselves
together to worship Jehovah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a man of middle age, and his hair was
slightly tinged with gray—exposure, or hardship, or
sorrow had made him prematurely old—his form was
slightly bent, and his face was brown, as though the
burning sunlight of the East had rested long upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the priest turned to the people at the conclusion
of the service of the day, and said⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye who do truly and earnestly repent you of your
sins, and are in love and charity with your neighbors,
and intend to lead a new life, following the commandments
of God, and walking from henceforth in his holy
ways, draw near with faith, and take this holy Sacrament
to your comfort; and make your humble confession
to Almighty God, devoutly kneeling”; the stranger
arose, but seemed as he did so, overcome with strong
emotion; but in a moment more he had mastered it,
and followed a portion of the congregation to the altar.
And he knelt there beside Grace Lovering, and partook
with her the consecrated elements; his hands trembled
when they grasped the cup filled with the Saviour’s
blood, but I do not think that was because of the emotion
arising from the thought that he might be partaking
unworthily, so much as from the fact that he was once
more standing and kneeling in the village church,
where since his boyhood he had not trod; it was because
he was kneeling beside a woman who as a child
had been his embodied dream of all perfection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had sought her amid the many faces totally
strange around him; and when his eyes had turned
from one to another, and he knew that thus far they
had sought in vain, when they had fallen on her face
at last, he knew that it was she—the little girl—the
woman middle-aged—whom he sought, and a thrill,
and a thought of thanksgiving swept through his soul,
as he looked on her still so lovely face. He felt that
he had come <span class='it'>home</span>—he dared to hope that he should
never be a wanderer again—and even in that sacred
place his wild thoughts finished the romance which had
been so long in its narration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the congregation went from the little church,
and Grace turned alone toward her pleasant cottage
home, the eyes of the stranger followed her—and—his
feet, as of necessity, followed too. There was very
little in the quiet village that seemed familiar and dear
to Hugh Willson, as he walked down the almost noiseless
street. Prosperity had not come with its years to
Romulus, and the little town had, I confess, a decided
broken-down appearance; but it was not for love of
the village Hugh had sought it; it was not because of
<span class='it'>its</span> beauty he thought it a very Paradise! He was
dreaming still a dream that had haunted him, or rather
that he had been dreaming for a score of years, and
how, what if this day he must awaken from it forever?</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had reached the house he had seen the
lady enter, he paused a moment, hesitatingly, for the
heart of the stern man beat wildly. If it should not
prove to be her after all—though he knew <span class='it'>that</span> was an
idle fear—but, would she care to remember him—must
he look upon her, and see her at last slowly and coldly
recognize him? Must he listen to her, and then depart
again to laugh at his own folly, and to curse at the
madness and stupidity of his day-dreaming? He
might find her bound by ties lasting as life to another.
But <span class='it'>if</span> was never decisive, and Hugh Willson must
speak with Grace Germain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knocked at the door of the cottage, and the
widow, who had preceded him by a few moments,
answered his call immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does a lady called Miss Germain live here?”
asked the stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was once my name,” replied Grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Once</span>, thought Hugh, and he had but little heart to
proceed when he heard that answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I come in and ask of her father and mother?
It is many years since I left this place, and I do not
find many of my old friends here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a momentary light illumining the face of
the lady as she heard these words, but it passed, and
she did not speak; but leading the way into the parlor,
she motioned the gentleman to a seat, then she said⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
“My father and mother have been dead these many
years. I do not wonder that the village seems altered
to one who has been long a stranger here, for the little
life it once had is now quite gone, and there are but
few of the old settlers left here now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause, and the stranger seemed to have
forgotten the inquiries he had intended making. While
she was speaking he seemed lost; but he was only
living so intensely in the present, and the rush and
confusion of thought was so great he knew not what
to say. The chief thing that he longed to know, was
not who had grown rich, and who poor, who was
dead, and who married, and who had moved away,
but—did Grace Germain remember an old playmate
who had given her a rose-bud ever so many years ago?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The longer he thought, only the more embarrassing
grew the stranger’s situation. Would she not laugh
to hear that he had come, when the summer-time of
life was well nigh passed, weary, and worn out with
worldly trials and sorrows and doubts, to simply ask a
woman if she remembered him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know that you remember,” he said at last—but
having proceeded thus far he stopped. “Have
you ever heard—” he began again, and then he broke
off suddenly, seemingly forgetful of the question he
had meant to ask. But this hesitation would not do—and
the man knew it would not—and so he started up,
and, as though the time was short, and they the last
words he ever intended uttering, he approached the
lady, exclaiming,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grace Germain, don’t you remember a boy who
went to school here long ago, in the old frame school-house,
whose name was Hugh Willson?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—yes—I do indeed! How could I have been
so stupid! Hugh, I welcome you back with all my
heart,” was the frank and generous answer, and Grace
and the <span class='it'>boy</span>-lover shook hands heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rubicon was fairly passed; he was remembered,
he was welcome! and in his gratitude Hugh forgot
to wonder if Grace had a husband living still, and if he
had gone off on a journey! He forgot all, save that
the child had grown to be a woman he could both love
and honor—and for a moment so complete was his
happiness, that the words would not have been an
empty sound from his lips, “Lord, now let thy servant
depart in peace!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what thought Grace as she looked upon the
face of which but one feature, the dark and thoughtful
eyes, seemed familiar? <span class='it'>She</span> thought, “Does he remember
the letter he wrote me from Arabia—and was
it truth he wrote?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sabbath bell rung vainly in the ears of the long
parted boy and girl that afternoon, but at night-fall the
wife of Clarence Lovering led the way to the old
burial-ground, and showed Hugh Willson the graves
of her parents and of her husband. And he on whose
arm she leaned then, felt no pang of jealousy when her
lip faltered and her eyes wet, as she spoke of the
bridegroom of her youth—for Grace had not listened
coldly or carelessly to her companion as he had spoken
to her such words as these⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grace, we are neither of us young any longer. I
have grown gray in my hard struggle with life—but
there is nothing gray or dead about our hearts. I
know that by the strong and joyous beating of my own,
I know it by the heavenly peace that marks your life,
surrounding you as it were with a very halo of glory.
But the passionate glow of feeling is, I am equally confident,
with neither of us any more. The noise of the
bounding brooks has gone—like the quiet, deep flow
of the river is the course of our existence now. The
waves leap not so brightly in the sunlight, but still the
broad beams of the sun fall down as warmly and as
cheerily upon us. And is it too late, because I am old,
for me to find a realization of that dream which has
haunted me so long? I have been wild and fickle in
the eyes of men; perhaps my way of life, could you
know it all, has not been such as you would look approvingly
upon; but, in the midst of all worldly excitements,
I have always borne a talisman in my heart
that has preserved me honorable and true—the thought
of you, Grace! I have come here, not expecting to
find the little girl I left, neither altogether a woman
who has known nothing of sorrow and care; I have
come to pray that I may, even at this late hour, become
your husband, your life-companion. My prayer
is fraught with no ordinary hope—it is not the bewildering
dream of youth I am now indulging—it is the
highest, strongest, noblest desire of my manhood!
Have I sought in vain, or must I go forth once more a
wanderer, and friendless, with another and dearer
image than has heretofore been impressed on my life,
the image of the matchless woman I have lost—or
rather cannot win?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Grace had listened to his words with tears of
gratitude; she had given him her hand, and nobly said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have not sought in vain, dear Hugh. I thank
God that you are here, and if you again become a
wanderer, a pilgrim, ready to give up all but you in
this life, will tread beside you! Henceforth, there are
no mountains, nor deserts, nor oceans that can divide
us—the lengthening shades of years falling around us
are grateful and pleasant—the quiet paths of life we
will pursue together. Thank God that you are here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace Lovering was not, it is true, a very youthful
bride when she was made Hugh Willson’s wife, but
had she been more beautiful than “Grace Greenwood’s”
most exquisite dream of womanly loveliness,
she had not proved more lovable to the wanderer,
who, when the shadows of years were folding round
him, found in her a friend, and a wife, and a worshiped
ideal!</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were some who laughed, to be sure—there
are always some that laugh and poh! at romances in
real life—and some there were who said it was all fal
de ral, the idea of a man and woman of <span class='it'>such</span> an age
marrying for <span class='it'>love</span>. I only wish in its marvelous “progress”
the world had not journeyed up to that icy peak
whence all human love, and love matches among humans,
is to be regarded as the folly of fools, and the
madness of delusion!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let the miserable woman now reading this page,
who in her girlhood wedded wealth—or the wretched
man who in his youth was led captive by the deceitful
smiles of beauty—let these, if there be any such—and
I know very well there are multitudes—look for once
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
within the peaceful cottage where our hero and the
dear heroine live, and if they do not speedily begin to
think with amaze on their own paltry lives, and wonder
when their romance is to begin, then—why then—I
will not strive any more to teach the people!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Look you, reader, and more especially if you be
young and beautiful, do not sell your birthright for a
tasteless mess of pottage—ah, in that case you may as
well begin to look for a tragedy, and a fearful kind of
denouement, instead of a romance and a pleasant closing
of the scene!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And furthermore the Wayside Voice saith not.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY RICHARD PENN SMITH.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus spoke the gray-haired dervise. Selim was
left to my care; his dying parents bequeathed him an
ample fortune, and their example of virtue and affection.
Such was his inheritance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a dreamy boy, in whose soul the opposite
passions reveled. Gentle as the dove, yet, under
aggression, fierce as the tiger. He loved as angels
love; hated as fiends hate. Framed as delicately as
the gazelle, yet every sinew was endowed with the
tenacity of steel. At the age of manhood, I, his old
preceptor, bowed to the superior endowments of my
pupil, but knew not the fountain of his knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have said he was a dreamy boy, yet he had made
the broad pages of nature his book of knowledge, even
while dreaming. The fertile earth presented her abundant
lap overflowing with fruit to delight his palate;
the flowers peered in his face with their variegated
eyes, and sent forth their incense, even while he trod
upon them. The cadence of the waterfall, the low
twittering of the wearied bird as it flitted to its fledglings
in the nest, and the murmuring of the passing
breeze as it struggled through the grove, were to him
a lullaby that charmed to sleep as the angels sleep.
Nature was his mother, and she nursed him with play-things
as her child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have seen him by the small streams composing
songs to the music that the dimpled waters babbled,
until his rosy cheeks dimpled and laughed in concert
with the rippling brook, as if it were a thing of life,
rejoicing in its existence, as his own pure heart rejoiced.
They laughed and babbled together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the wood-clad mountains, at midnight, when the
elements battled, I have seen him straining his feeble
voice to sound the master-key that attunes to universal
harmony; and having caught it, he would spring like
the antelope to a lofty waterfall to discover the same
note there; and then turn up his bright face to the stars
that smiled upon him, and laugh, expecting to hear
them respond to his note as they revolved on their
eternal axes. His dark eyes smiled, and the conscious
stars smiled back in the heaven of his dark eyes, which
danced with delight in the diamond rays of the stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flowers were books to him, and from every leaf he
read wisdom fragrant with truth. He cultivated them
as a father would his last child. The little birds were
his companions, and every morning he joined their
concert until the tiny minstrels seemed to imagine that
he was the leader of their orchestra. All nature was
to him one mighty minister, bestowing all, while he
asked from nature no more than the blessed privilege
of imitating her, by bestowing on his fellow man all in
return. He had a dog, whose former owner had
thrown into a stream to drown as worthless. Selim
swam and saved the ill-looking cur, who followed him
ever after until it appeared that instinct trod close upon
the heel of reason. Selim in his turn, while bathing,
became exhausted, and sinking beneath the stream, the
dog plunged in and saved his dying master. Was this
instinct or reason? It matters not, but Selim perceived
that the Prophet had made his humanity toward a
friendless dog the means of prolonging his own existence
here. Despise not little things, cried Mehemet,
for the smallest is of magnitude in the sight of the Prophet.
A straw may break the back of the overburthened;
one word may consign a man to poverty or
prosperity, one deed to hell or heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Selim’s wants were few, his fortune ample, which
he bestowed upon the deserving with as liberal a hand
as it had been bestowed upon himself. Still he labored
in the pursuit he had adopted, not for self-aggrandizement,
but to assist others; and he knew not why
man should be a sluggard while all nature is incessantly
at work. The bee and ant work in their season—and
even the spider too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His garden blossomed as Eden, and the flowers
offered up their grateful incense even as they faded
and died upon the universal altar of Nature’s God.
His aviary from morn until night was vocal, and when
the flaming chariot of the bright eye of day was
whirled by fiery-footed steeds over the eastern hills, I
have seen him with his flute, surrounded by nature’s
tiny choristers pouring forth their matins until some
note in the universal harmony touched the heart of his
poor shaggy cur who sported around and tried to bark
in unison. Then Selim laughed outright, and the birds
stopped their hymns, and seemed to laugh with Selim,
and the poor dog slunk away abashed, and slyly laughed
at his miserable failure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He married the dark-eyed Biribi. Selim was a
poet; his soul reveled alike in tempest or sunshine, and
his voice was as musical as the wings of the bee when
he distills honey. He possessed the sweets of the
bee, and his sting also. Biribi was abjectly poor, but
in Selim’s eyes as full of truth and as beautiful as the
houries. He exclaimed, I will raise poverty above oppression,
and place virtue where all her handmaids may
minister to her enjoyment. Alas! it was but a young
poet’s dream—and such dreams are too frequently disturbed
by palpable agony. Thus spoke Mehemet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had a friend who was his fellow-student while
under my charge. Selim loved him as a brother, and
when he married he requested Zadak to dwell with
him. Neither house, garden, nor fields could be more
beautiful, while his flocks and herds were nature’s
ornaments. Such was Selim’s Eden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zadak borrowed a portion of his fortune, which he
squandered; but the poor boy simply replied, “no
matter, we require but little, and enough still remains
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
to make us happy. Thank the Prophet for that which
we still possess, and repine not for that which we
have lost. We can labor with our fellow-men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Biribi became estranged from the pure being who
fancied he had made in her bosom a nest for his dove-like
heart to sing in. He awoke from a dream of repose
to battle with the tempest. Zadak had betrayed him,
and the gentle spirit of my boy was crushed between
the sledge and the anvil; but the eternal fire that burnt
within him, burst forth in one mighty blaze as the
sledge fell; and even the sledge and the anvil rejoiced
at the fire they had elicited from his heart’s blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was to be done? The question was soon
settled. The dove had winged its way to heaven, but
left the tiger on earth to punish the injuries done to the
dove. Selim slew Zadak, and then walked to the
tribunal to receive his sentence, knowing that an act
that was approved by the immutable principle of eternal
justice in heaven, would be pronounced a damning
crime by drones who are fed to dole out punishment
for breaking the conventional rules by which fools and
knaves are linked together on earth. He confessed all
before man as he had already confessed before God.
Ignominious death was his sentence in the eye of his
fellow-creature; but God changed his sentence to that
of eternal life; he died of a broken-heart, and escaped
man’s justice, tempered with degradation, and flew to
the limpid and overflowing fountain—the bosom of his
Creator for justice—knowing it to be a principle of
eternity, and not of time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I buried him beneath a cluster of trees, where he
had pursued his studies. He had no mourners except
myself and his dog. The grave of the rich man
is seldom bedewed by the tears of his heirs; while
the poor hard-working man may have many sincere
mourners, provided they depended upon his daily labor
for their bread. It was spring-time; I planted flowers
from his garden over his grave, and placed his aviary
among the trees. The birds sang and the flowers
smiled as if he were still with them. One morning I
missed his dog, and searched for him until the impulse
of nature guided my footsteps to the boy’s grave. The
dog was there, pillowed on a cluster of fragrant flowers—dying;
big tears stood in his leadened eyes, while
the little birds from the blooming trees, warbled his
requiem. They knew the dog, and he knew the birds
even while dying. The flowers were bedewed with
his tears, and I buried him beside his master, beneath
the flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Autumn came; the little birds had taken wing; the
grove was no longer vocal; the flowers had faded, and
their fragrance had passed away. Well, I exclaimed,
the rosy-fingered spring will return, leading the birds
back to warble as usual, and the flowers will revive
with their former fragrance and beauty? “And is my
boy dead?” my soul shrieked. “No!” replied a voice,
kindly, and it seemed to me as if the lips were smiling
as the judgment passed the lips, “the boy is not dead,
but sleepeth, awaiting his spring-time, when the birds
will sing, and the flowers bloom for him again, and
bloom for eternity.” Thus spoke the dervise, and his
old frame chuckled with delight, for he was confident
of the fulfillment of the promise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I reposed by his grave, said Mehemet, and had a
vision, which was this. His grave opened, and he
arose more beautiful than when in the bloom of manhood.
There was a bright star just over his heart,
and methought it was composed of the tears his dying
dog had shed upon his grave, and I smiled in my sleep
at the fantastic thought. The flowers sent forth their
incense, and myriads of birds, as he ascended from his
tomb, fluttered about him, leading the way, warbling
their anthems; the gay flowers smiled at heaven, as
if they were the eyes of the teeming earth, laughing
their gratitude. The features of Selim became more
benign as he ascended; the songs of the birds more
seraphic, and the fragrance of the flowers more refreshing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly a cloud of inky darkness covered the face
of the earth. Two ghastly figures emerged from it,
with uplifted eyes, that were rayless, and supplicating
hands that trembled with terror. Oh! what must that
man be, exclaimed Mehemet, who trembles before the
All-merciful, even while supplicating mercy! Selim
cast a look of compassion upon the guilty pair, and
tried to tear the star from his bosom to throw to them,
but the more he strove, the brighter the star became—it
illuminated his ascending spirit—and finding his
efforts fruitless, he raised his radiant face toward the
boundless blue canopy, cheered onward by the hymns
of his little choristers through regions of light, and
the teeming earth smiled as she poured forth her grateful
incense, as if jealous that the disembodied spirit
might forget the fragrance of this world while reveling
in the atmosphere of heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I heard a shriek of despair, and turning to the sea of
darkness which was fearfully troubled, I beheld the
guilty pair, desperately struggling in their agony against
the angry billows. They struggled in vain. With a
fiendlike shriek they disappeared, and sunk through a
rayless abyss of doom, without even the tear of a dog
to bewail their destiny. Selim soared upward, and
still more effulgent became the heavens as he ascended.
There was one mighty strain of seraphic music that
filled the universe; the blue arch opened, from which
issued a stream of light strong enough to restore vision
to the rayless eyes of the ancient dead; then I awoke
as I beheld Selim enter the eternal portals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, continued the old man, may be but a dream at
present, but the time will come when it must be
verified. He then slowly tottered to his cell to dream
out the remnant of his existence.</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE BLUE-BIRD.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Blue-Bird is a great favorite with the farmer.
Its principal food being beetles, spiders, grasshoppers,
caterpillars, and other insects, he affords great assistance
to the fruit-trees, and vegetables of all kinds. He
is one of the earliest spring visiters, appearing in Pennsylvania
in the latter end of February, and trilling forth
his feeble though pleasing song more than a week before
the other early visiters. The species ranges over
a large extent of latitude, being found in the forty-eighth
parallel, and southward to the tropics. They
probably also migrate to the Bermudas and West
Indies, and certainly pass the winter in our Southern
States and Mexico. The common belief that this bird
remains dormant during the winter in Pennsylvania,
appears to be ill-founded; since the few who do not
migrate, no doubt seek out some warmer shelter near
man than is afforded by the bleakness of nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The early song of the Blue-Bird announces to the
farmer the approach of spring. So gladdening is this
to the rustic villager, that he generally takes every
method to accommodate his familiar little companion,
building boxes for him, exposing materials, and imitating
his plaintive whistle as he hops along the furrow
of the plough. The affection of the male bird for his
mate is remarkable. “When he first begins his
amours,” says an accurate observer, “it is pleasing to
behold his courtship; his solicitude to please and to
secure the favor of his beloved female. He uses the
tenderest expressions, sits close by her, caresses, and
sings to her his most endearing warblings. When
seated together, if he espies an insect delicious to her
taste he takes it up, flies with it to her, spreads his
wings over her and puts it in her mouth.” On such
occasions, should a rival stray within the hallowed
limits he is treated without mercy, and the victor returns
to warble out his strain of exultation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nest of the Blue-Bird is generally made in the
hollow of an old tree, or in the free quarters provided
by man. The female lays five or six eggs, of a pale
blue color, and raises two broods in a season. Their
affection for their young is fully equal to that of the
male for his mate, and when the hen is sitting the
second time, the former brood is cherished and reared
by the other parent. In the fall, when insect food becomes
scarce, they eat berries, seeds, persimmons and
other fruit. Their song is a soft and agreeable warble,
uttered with open quivering wings. “In his motions
and general character,” says Wilson, “he has great
resemblance to the Robin Redbreast of Britain; and
had he the brown olive of that bird, instead of his own
blue, could scarcely be distinguished from him. Like
him he is known to almost every child; and shows as
much confidence in man, by associating with him in
summer, as the other by his familiarity in winter. He
is also of a mild and peaceful disposition, seldom fighting
or quarreling with other birds. His society is
courted by the inhabitants of the country, and few
farmers neglect to provide for him in some suitable
place a snug little summer-house, ready fitted and rent
free. For this he more than sufficiently repays them
by the cheerfulness of his song, and the multitude of
injurious insects which he daily destroys. Toward
fall, that is in the month of October, his song changes
to a single plaintive note, as he passes over the yellow
many-colored woods; and its melancholy air recalls to
our minds the approaching decay of the face of nature.
Even after the trees are stripped of their leaves, he
still lingers over his native fields, as if loath to leave
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Blue-Bird is nearly seven inches in length,
with the wings remarkably full and broad. The
upper part of the body, neck and head are sky-blue,
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
inclining to purple. The under parts are chestnut, the
bill and legs black, with portions of the same color
about the wings, tail and sides. In the female the
colors are less bright. The young are hardy, strong,
and highly teachable. The Blue-Bird is not often subjected
to the confinement of the cage.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i141.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0007' style='width:450px;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE GROUND-ROBIN.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>This bird is also known as the Towee-finch, the
Tshe-wink and Pee-wink, names derived from its
favorite notes. It is found in great numbers in woods
and overgrown meadows, and sometimes along the
banks of streams, and is both familiar and playful. A
pair will sometimes roam for a great distance along a
water-course, scratching for insects, worms or seeds,
and encouraging each other by their simple cry of
tow-wee, tow-wee. They sometimes forage along gardens
or pea-patches. On such occasions, they behold
the approach of man with but little concern, and fly
off only when in danger of being taken. The species
is found in Canada, and probably farther north among
the Rocky Mountains, and southward throughout the
United States. They are, however, more abundant
east of the Alleghanies than to the west. Sometimes,
but not often, they pass the winter in Pennsylvania,
but are constantly in the milder States during that
season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their manner of building is rather peculiar; the
nest being fixed on the ground, below the surface, and
covered with leaves, or the shelter of an adjoining
bush. It is rarely raised above the ground. The
materials are fine bark, leaves, moss, dried grass and
down. Sometimes part of the adjoining herbage is
employed. The eggs are four or five in number, white,
with a flesh color tint, and spotted with brown. In
New England they raise but one brood, but in warm
States two, the first in June, and the second during the
following month. During this period they artfully
draw the intruder from their charge, by pretending
lameness, and feebly retreating as he pursues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Ground-Robin is about eight inches long, and
eleven across the wings. The throat, neck, and whole
upper part of the body is black, with feathers of the
same color, interspersed with white, in the wings and
tail. The belly is white, with bay thighs. In the
female and young the black of the male is changed for
olive brown, and there is less pure white in the tail
and wings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is rather a dangerous experiment, this sporting
with the feelings of a sweetheart, as many a loving
swain has found; as Andy Bell and Harry Lee found,
when they indulged in a walk home from church with
Lilly James and Aggy Moore, to the neglect of two
sweet sisters, Jane and Florence May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jane and Florence were the real sweethearts. Of
the moonlight rambles they had enjoyed together; of
the loving words whispered in the maidens’ ears; of
the kisses beneath the shadows of old trees, stolen
from half shrinking lips, we will say nothing. But
such things had been. And even more. Mutual
pledges of love had passed. Harry had vowed to
Jane that, as she was the sweetest maiden in all the
village, so she was to him the dearest; and Jane had
drooped her eyes, and leaned closer to him, thus silently
responding to the declaration of love; and when
he took her hand, she let it linger in his warm clasp
as if he had a right to its possession. And the same
thing, slightly varied according to temperament, had
happened with Andy and Florence. For months, the
two young men were untiring in their attention to the
sisters. Invariably, when the little congregation that
worshiped in the village church on Sundays was dismissed,
Andy and Harry were at the door, waiting for
the expectant maidens, whom they as invariably attended
home, lingering always by the way, to make
the distance longer. And when the evening shadows
fell in the winter, or the sun sunk low toward the
western hills in the spring and summer time, at the
waning of the Sabbath, the young men were sure to
make their appearance at the quiet cottage home of the
happy sisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it had been for months, and all the village knew
that they were sweethearts; and it was even said—how
the intelligence was gained we know not—that,
at the next Christmas, there would be a double
wedding in Heathdale. Thus it was, when, one bright
Sunday morning, as Andy Bell and Harry Lee were
on their way to church, the former, who was in a gayer
humor than usual, said, laughing as he spoke⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose we plague the girls a little after meeting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” asked Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’ll walk home with Aggy Moore, I’ll play
the gallant to Lilly James.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Agreed,” was the thoughtless reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet,” said Andy, “I wouldn’t give the little
finger of Florence for Lilly’s whole body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor would I give Jane’s little finger for a dozen
Aggy Moores.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even at this early stage of the affair, both parties
half repented; but neither felt like proposing to give
up the little frolick agreed upon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the service the young lovers found their eyes
meeting those of their sweethearts with accustomed
frequency. But neither Andy nor Harry felt as comfortable
as usual. Besides being about to deprive
themselves of a long enjoyed pleasure, both felt misgivings
as to the effect of their temporary desertion and
disappointment of the expectant maidens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the benediction was said, and the congregation
began moving toward the door. Andy and Harry were
out before the girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we do it?” asked the former.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, certainly,” replied Harry. And yet this was
not said with the best grace in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s Aggy,” whispered Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” returned Harry, moving forward, as Aggy
stepped from the church-door. Just behind her was
Jane, with her bright, dancing eyes, and lips just parting
in a smile, as she caught sight of her lover. She
moved forward more quickly, but stopped suddenly.
Harry had spoken to Aggy, and was now walking
away by her side. Just then Lilly James came forth,
and Andy, crossing before Florence, who appeared at
the same time, bowed to the maiden, and seeming not
to see Florence, moved away from the church-door,
smiling and chatting with a free and careless air.
Neither of the young men looked behind to see the
effect of all this upon the two young girls. But, to
some extent, they imagined their feelings, and the picture
fancy presented was not the most agreeable to
contemplate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It required an effort on the part of both Andy and
Harry to continue to play the agreeable to the two
young ladies they had substituted thus temporarily, and
in sport, for their sweethearts, long enough to see them
fairly home. They did not meet again until toward
evening, and then each was on his way to seek the
cottage-home of the one loved most dearly of any thing
in the wide world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder what they will say?” was uttered by
Andy, in a doubting tone, as they moved along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodness knows! I’m afraid Jane took it hard,”
remarked Harry. “I saw her countenance change as
I turned to walk with Aggy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a foolish prank, to make the best of it. But
we must laugh it off with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I rather think we shall be paid back in our own
coin,” said Harry. “Jane, I know, has a little spice
about her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Harry was not far wrong. When the two
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
young men arrived at the cottage, and entered in their
usual familiar way, the room where the maidens sat,
they were received in a manner not in the least agreeable
to their feelings. Both Jane and Florence had
been deeply hurt by the conduct of their lovers; and
both had indulged freely during the afternoon in the
luxury of tears. The meaning of what had happened,
they couldn’t tell. Had all this appearance of affection
been a mere counterfeit? Were they the victims of a
heartless <a id='coquet'></a>coquetry? Or had Lilly and Aggy, through
some strange influence, won the hearts of their lovers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great was the relief experienced by the troubled
sisters when, on the waning of the Sabbath, they saw
their truant swains approaching as usual. But, with
this sense of relief, came a maidenly indignation, and a
determination to resent the wanton slight that had been
put upon them. Clouds were on the faces once so
smiling and happy, when the young men entered, and
their presence, so far from dispersing these clouds, only
caused them to grow darker. It was in vain that
every effort was made to remove them; not a sun-ray
came to dispel their gloomy shadows. Explanations
were made. The apparent slight was acknowledged
as only a merry jest. However this relieved the oppressed
hearts of the maidens, it did not lighten up
their sober faces. Forgiveness and smiles were not
to come so easily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy affected to treat the whole matter lightly, and
rather jested with Florence; but Harry’s sweetheart
seemed so deeply grieved and wounded, that he had
little to say after the first few efforts at reconciliation.
Finally, the young men went away, apparently unforgiven;
and all parties, for the next week, were unhappy
enough. Sunday came again; and now the
doubt in the minds of the young men was, whether, if
they offered to go home as usual with Jane and Florence,
they would be permitted by the offended maidens to do
so. This doubt was, in a measure, dispelled during
the morning service, for more than a dozen times did
Andy catch a stealthy glance from Florence, in which
was a beam of forgiveness; and the same thing happened
to Harry as he turned his eyes frequently upon
Jane. At last the service ended; and, as the young
girls passed from the door, their lovers were beside
them as usual. There was no repulse. The maidens
were too glad to have them there once more. But,
the feelings of each were sobered. Evening came, and
they met as before. Their intercourse was tender but
not joyous as it had been. And thus it was for weeks
ere their hearts lost a sense of oppression. The reader
may be sure that there were no more games at
cross purposes after this. The lovers were cured of
all inclination to indulge further in that species of
pastime.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY “SIMON.”</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A strange old man was my Uncle Tom. He was
my father’s only and elder brother, and more than all,
he was a bachelor; not one of those sour specimens of
humanity who are continually railing at everybody
and every thing—more especially “the sex”—but a
hearty, hale, good-natured gentleman of the old school,
straight as a poplar, and his heart had as many green
leaves withal. He was still a boy in feeling, though
winter had begun to spread its snows over his head.
He was far from hating women, though when he talked
of them, or thought of them, a look of sadness would
sometimes overspread his countenance; and when he
saw some fairy phantom that had not yet escaped her
“teens,” in the full flush of maiden grace and beauty,
old recollections seemed to come over him with a deep
and maddening influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one ever told me the cause of this temporary dejection,
and Uncle Tom seemed unwilling to be questioned
<a id='concern'></a>concerning it. There needed no questioning. From
our cottage, a smooth-worn path led across the fields
to the village church-yard, which lay at about a quarter
of a mile distant. Passing through a gap in the wall,
it wound among the grass-grown hillocks, and stopped
abruptly before a small, gray stone, which stood in the
corner nearest the church, and on which this simple
epitaph was engraved: Mary, æt. 18. This told his
whole story; for the small, gray stone was overgrown
with lichens and mosses, and I remember the
solitary pathway when but a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Tom was not rich, but he had enough to
satisfy all his wants. He had always lived with us
since my remembrance, and we all had a mysterious
love and veneration for him, which we could but half
explain. His little room on the south-west corner of
the house we never entered without a special invitation;
not because we stood in any fear of him, but because
we respected his quiet, half-eccentric manner,
and were not willing to disturb his solitary studies and
meditations. We were often invited there of an
evening, for Uncle Tom liked to have young, happy
people around him. He used to say it made him young
again, and caused his silver hairs to hide themselves;
and he thought a man should always have the heart
of a child, no matter how much experience and life-labor
had whitened his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During our visits to his study, we were at liberty to
handle every thing which came within our reach, and
the room was generally in a sweet confusion when we
left it. Yet this did not trouble him, it rather pleased
him the more. In truth he was so good-natured that
nothing could vex him; and I remember one evening
when he pulled sister Ruth’s doll out of his great horn
inkstand, where it stood, heels upward, like a pearl-diver,
his only exclamation was, “Just as I used to be—children
all over!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Directly opposite the great arm-chair, where he
usually sat during the day, hung a picture; yet it was
not for us to see. A plain blue curtain was always
drawn over it, which hung as silently, and always in
the same folds, as if it had not been withdrawn for
many years. I knew it was the portrait of a young
girl, and very beautiful; for one evening, when, according
to invitation, we were in the study playing the
mischief with every thing that came under our hands,
a slight breeze from the west window fluttered and
raised the curtain, and revealed the picture to me by
the dim light of the study-lamp. I, of course, did
not know who it was intended to represent, but it
was always connected in my mind with the solitary
path to the church-yard; and I always thought of her
as the Mary of the little gray stone; yet I never spoke
of it to any one, not even sister Ruth. It seemed
something sacred, something which I ought not to
know, and that the knowledge thus accidentally acquired
ought not to be divulged by me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the pleasantest thing of all was, when Uncle
Tom came down into the kitchen of a winter’s evening,
and told one of the beautiful stories which he could
relate so well. Ah! no one could tell stories like
Uncle Tom. He would enter into the subject so
earnestly, that we took every thing for truth, and
laughed or cried, as the nature of the case demanded;
and many a time in the midst of a sad passage, my
father has let the fire go out of his pipe before it was
half smoked, and I have seen the tears stream down
sister Ruth’s cheek, and heard her sob as if some great
misfortune were hanging over some one of us; and I
have known Uncle Tom’s voice to grow tremulous;
and his lip quiver, as if something in the narrative lay
near his heart, but by a powerful effort he would always
master his feelings and go calmly on with his story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall try to report some of these stories at second
hand, narrating carefully as my memory serves, always
in Uncle Tom’s words; but they will be nothing so
good as when he, with his low musical voice and
earnest manner, related them to our little family, who,
in likening silence formed a half circle around the
huge walnut logs that blazed and simmered on the
kitchen hearth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the last night of December, and the north
wind howled around the chimney, and the icicles
clattered on the eaves and dropped against the casement
with a tip-tap, like wayfarers asking admittance.
A great fire of logs was blazing on the hearth, and the
half circle was almost formed. On one side of the
fire-place sat father, double-shotting his black tobacco-pipe.
Next him was mother, just turning the heel of
a stocking. Sister Ruth occupied the next chair, and
she was very busy working a wash-woman’s register
on the top of a bachelor’s pincushion; beside her sat
the bachelor for whom this piece of domestic goods
was working. He was a cousin, and bore the family
name—Charley, we called him. He and Ruth seemed
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
to enjoy each other’s society very much, and passed
the greater part of their leisure time together. My
place was next to Cousin Charley, and on my left hand
the vacant arm-chair was waiting for Uncle Tom—to
complete the family circle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the door opened, and the pleasant old man
appeared. He entered rubbing his hands and smiling
most benignantly. Every chair moved about an inch,
as if to make room for him, though each one knew
there was room enough already. Father lighted his
pipe, and mother turned the heel; sister Ruth left off
her embroidery in the middle of “shirts,” and Cousin
Charley gave his chair a hitch nearer to her, while I
sat quite still. Even the blazing logs on the fire gave
an extra hiss and flare, as if they, too, were making
preparations to listen attentively. Uncle Tom, with a
few pleasant words, and a great many pleasant smiles,
took his accustomed seat and commenced the evening
entertainment in these words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>About five miles from Boston, on one of the great
thoroughfares leading to the city, there used to stand
an old-fashioned country-seat. It was placed somewhat
back from the road, and screened from the dust
by a thick-set hawthorn-hedge, which grew as straight
and regular as brick-work. The walks within were
laid out with the same regularity and neatness, and
lead with many a labyrinthine turn through the whole
premises. Now it took you by an oval pond, where
the bright scales of gold fish glanced in the sun; now
among flower-beds formed into Catharine-wheels and
gothic crosses; then away among groves and trellises
almost impervious to the sun. There were a great
many beautiful things that I shall not attempt to tell you
of. Every thing was beautiful, and proclaimed a
wealthy proprietor, even to the silver plate on the front
door, bearing in bold writing-hand, the name, “John
Maynard.” He was rich—John Maynard was a retired
merchant. In the full flush of commercial prosperity,
his beloved wife had fallen into the quiet sleep
of death. After that, business grew irksome to him;
he could not bear the busy hum of the city; the home
where he had been happy, was so no more to him;
and taking with him his oldest and most trusty clerk,
he, with his only child, Alice, removed to this quiet
spot. The care of his property was left almost entirely
to his tried and honest clerk, David Deans; his
own time was occupied either in his study or in the
society of his daughter, who, being an only child, was,
of course, indulged in all her little whims and fancies,
until she had assumed the reins of government, and
was nearly spoiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening Mr. Maynard, or Old John, as he was
familiarly called, sat on the western piazza as the sun
was setting. He looked the hale and hearty old gentleman,
one before whom care and trouble would
vanish like the thin spiral clouds of cigar smoke, which
ever and anon he puffed from between his lips. Yet
withal he had a look of determination, something
which said he would have things his own way when
he desired it; and yet he had a way of gaining his ends
so pleasantly and adroitly, that no one knew his intentions
until they were accomplished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Puff, puff, there he sat smoking away and thinking
of something very pleasant, no doubt, for a smile would
occasionally play round the corners of his mouth, and
he would rub his hands together with infinite satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon a light step was heard in the hall, and his
daughter, Alice, appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everybody said Alice was a beauty; and so far
everybody told the truth. Her dark hair and dark
eyes, and delicate complexion would win many a
heart that had sworn eternal hostility to her sex. And
then she was as full of life as of beauty, and had such
winning ways, that nothing could resist her. She inherited
from her father a slight vein of willfulness, and
it was really a pleasure to see them contending together,
Old John in his humorous, quiet way, bringing up irresistible
arguments, and she, dashing them all to pieces
by the most illogical processes imaginable; and he
would generally laugh and let her have her own way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Papa,” said she, “why did you send David Deans
away? I’m sure it was very cruel of you. He has
lived with us so long, and is so quiet and industrious!
I’m sure it will break his heart. And then, besides,
his poor sister will have to go into service again. It is
too bad, I declare⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now don’t, Ally,” said Old John, passing his
arm quietly around his daughter’s waist, and talking
in the best humor imaginable, “don’t trouble yourself
about David. What do you know about business?
You take care of the women-servants, and see that
we have tea on the table by seven o’clock exactly, for
I expect the new clerk every minute. I’ll take care
of David⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know I shan’t like the new clerk,” said she,
pouting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, who wants you to like him, little minx?”
said Old John, at the same time drawing her closer to
him, and giving her a hearty kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I shall hate him,” continued she, determined
to be obstinate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, hate him if you will,” replied her father, not
in the least angry; “but I can tell you he is a very
lively fellow, and not accustomed to be hated by the
ladies. However, you had better hate him. You must
reserve all your love for Harry Wilson, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that dreadful Harry Wilson,” exclaimed Alice,
struggling to throw off her father’s arm, by which he
still held her in close confinement. “Pray don’t talk
of him again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why not?” said Old John; “he is to be your
husband, you know.” And a smile, half merry, half
serious, played over his features as he said this. “His
father and I were old schoolmates, and he would die
of grief if he thought we were not to be brothers
after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His son and I were never old schoolmates, at all
events,” exclaimed Alice, still struggling, but in vain.
Old John held her fast, and his merry face settled into
a serious, earnest expression as he added,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides, he once saved my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice answered nothing. There was something in
the manner in which he said these words, as well as
in the meaning of the words themselves, which completely
subdued her. The tears beamed in her beautiful
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
dark eyes; she threw her arms round his neck
and rested her head on his shoulder; her long, black
locks streamed over his bosom—yet she said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old John drew her closer to him and kissed her
tenderly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, Ally, dear,” he said, “we wont talk any
more about it now. I know you will do all you can
to make your old father happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still she said nothing, but clung very close to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a good girl, was Alice, only a little willful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A servant entered, announcing Mr. Davis. This was
the new clerk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Conduct him this way,” said Mr. Maynard.
“Come, Ally, don’t let him surprise us in a family
quarrel. We must make his first impressions good
ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Things were put to rights in less time than it takes
to tell of it, and the new clerk approached them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad to see you, Walter,” exclaimed Old John,
grasping the new comer’s hand, and looking a cordial
welcome. “Ally, this is Walter Davis, the new clerk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding her determination to hate him, she
smiled very pleasantly as he took her hand, and her
welcome word was said with a very good grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new clerk was apparently about twenty-two
years of age, rather tall, but well formed; he was
dressed in a very plain suit—becoming his situation;
and yet there was something noble about him for all
that. You could see it in the firmly compressed lips,
the deep, thoughtful eye, and the easy, manly bearing.
He certainly was not the person one would choose
to hate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice was much surprised at his general personal
appearance and demeanor. Her ideas of a clerk were
all formed from the quiet, unpretending David Deans,
who had almost grown old in their service. She forgot
that the new comer was at present a visiter, not yet
having entered upon his clerkship. At the tea-table,
too, she observed how perfectly easy and composed he
seemed. He could answer questions without blushing,
and ask others without stammering. There was a
straightforwardness about him, which seemed to win
upon her father wonderfully, and he never seemed in
a more pleasant mood than then. There was something
in his manner so dignified and gentlemanly that
she, too, could not help reacting him, although in
her good-night to her father, she added, “I’m sure I
shall hate him for taking poor David’s place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a bit, Brother Tom,” interrupted father—“pipe’s
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Uncle Tom, “while Brother Bill is
lighting his pipe, we will glide over two months and
make ready for a new chapter.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Two months had passed away, and affairs went on
swimmingly at the country-seat. Old John seemed to
find his new clerk a remarkably pleasant companion,
and passed much of his time in the little counting-room.
He was fast growing into the good graces of
Miss Alice too; for true manliness will always find
its way into every heart. She began to like him very
much, and seemed pleased to have him near her; and
indeed would sometimes meet his advances more than
half way. Perhaps, like a dutiful daughter, she followed
her father’s example, and liked the clerk because
he did, or perhaps she thought he must be very
lonely, and took compassion on him: How this may
be I cannot tell; but I do know that she liked him, and
liked him very well too, as might be seen by any one
who observed her. She often walked in the direction
of the counting-room, which stood at some little distance
from the house, and frequently sat with her embroidery
in the trellised arbor that overlooked it. The
flowers, too, which always ornamented her parlor-mantle,
were generally gathered from the beds in this
part of the garden, although they were not half so
fragrant or pretty as those which grew nearer the
house. Indeed, she had found it necessary once or
twice to open the counting-room, and actually go in
when no one but the young clerk was there; and at such
times he received her with such a frank, cordial greeting,
and talked so pleasantly to her, that she would
gladly have changed her arbor boudoir for this little
room, crowded with business and ponderous ledgers
as it was. And once, when the clerk left her for a
moment, she actually climbed upon the long-legged
desk-stool, to see if it were really as uncomfortable as
it looked to be; at least so she said, when he, returning
suddenly, surprised her on that high perch. But
he helped her down so gently, and gallantly, that she
would have been willing to try the experiment often,
even if it were as uncomfortable as it looked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was always delighted whenever Walter requested
the pleasure of her company through the
grounds. She would take his arm without any unnecessary
coquetry, and full of life and love they would
thread every walk of the labyrinth, not excepting the
Catharine-wheels and the gothic arches. In the grove
they would listen to the songs of the birds, and together
wonder what they were saying to each other,
and invent many strange translations, interesting to
none but themselves. They would stand long on the
edge of the pond, and Alice leaned heavily on the
clerk’s arm, you may be sure, as they watched the
gold-fish darting across the little basin so rapidly that
the whole surface of the water seemed marked with
red lines. He gathered flowers for her, too, as they
walked leisurely along, and each bouquet thus formed
was, to her, a whole book of love, each flower telling
its own particular tale. As the sun touched the horizon
they would climb up to the arbor, while the birds
sung their “good-night,” and watch the bright colors
grow and fade upon the western sky, and build landscapes
and cathedrals and cottages of the ever-changing
clouds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet in his conversations with her, Walter was never
sickly sentimental or flattering. He always spoke just
what he felt; and sometimes a plump, downright
honest thought would find itself clothed in words,
which many would call coarse and ill-bred; but from
him they came so frankly that she never thought of
such a thing, but liked him the more for them. He
never flattered her, never told her how beautiful she
was, but his whole manner was a tacit acknowledgment
of her beauty, truer and plainer than words could
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
express it. And Alice was as simple, and talked as
plainly to him as if he had been a brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O, those evening walks were beautiful to both, but
they were laying a foundation for something deeper
and more lasting than common friendship, notwithstanding
Harry Wilson and the two good fathers.
Their natures were gradually blending into each other
like two neighboring colors of the rainbow, and the
line between them would soon become extinct, and a
separation must be the destruction of both. It was
very strange that Old John, with his brotherly intentions
toward Harry Wilson’s father, didn’t observe
this, for he often surprised them earnestly conversing
in the sunset arbor, long after the dews had begun to
fall and the birds had ceased their evening song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He must indeed have been very dull and stupid, not
to observe that something was going on between the
two young people, that would play the deuce with his
darling project. But no, he didn’t seem to; for he
was never in better spirits than then, never half so
talkative or playful. He evidently did not think his
cherished scheme was about to miscarry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening he and the clerk sat on the piazza together.
The parlor windows were open, and Alice
sat at the piano and played to them. Old John began
to talk about the business transactions of the day, and
seemed particularly delighted at certain good news
which he had heard, and which he had just finished
relating to the clerk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remarkable, isn’t it?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he might as well have talked to the plaster statue
of Neptune which stood on the green before him,
as to the young clerk. He was either listening attentively
to the music, or else his thoughts were far away,
for he took no notice of what Old John said to him,
but sat silent, his head leaning upon his hand and his
eyes fixed upon vacancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey! what’s all this?” exclaimed Old John, starting
up and shaking the clerk’s arm. “What! dreaming
by moonlight! A bad sign—very bad sign—too
romantic by half! Here, Ally—Ally! come here directly,”
he continued, shouting to his daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walter started up and would have prevented him,
but he continued to call, and soon the piano ceased to
sound, and Alice made her appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want, papa?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is this fellow,” he answered, “falling asleep
in the midst of our conversation; dreaming by moonlight!
I want you to keep him awake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg pardon, sir,” said the clerk, attempting an
excuse, “but I was thinking⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, but that wont do,” said Old John, “I was talking.
However, I will tell you how we will make it
up. You shall sing that duet with Alice; the one you
sung last night, and mind you don’t go to sleep before
it is finished, or—” and he finished the sentence with
a shake of the finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will undertake it willingly,” said the clerk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walter moved his chair closer by the side of Alice,
and took his seat. But there was still a difficulty;
neither of them could determine on the right pitch.
Alice ran and struck a note on the piano, and returned
sounding it all the way. She sat down, and her hand
involuntarily fell upon Walter’s; he pressed it in his
own, and the duet commenced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both the words and the music were very simple;
they were the expression of love, pure and holy; and
never did they sing better. Walter’s whole soul was
thrown into the words, and his heart beat to the sounds
his lips uttered. A slight pressure of her hand expressed
to Alice how truly, how deeply he felt the
beauty of love, and her voice trembled as she sung,
adding still more to the music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence for a short time after the sound
of their voices had ceased. It seemed Old John’s turn
to dream now. The beautiful music had called up old,
happy scenes to his mind; perhaps the thoughts of his
youth and first-love were leading him far away; for
he sat silently, with his hand drawn across his eyes,
as if to shade them from the moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice approached him, and drew her arm around
his neck. He started as if from a trance, and said—“That
was well, very well. I like that music. There,
now, Ally, you and Walter take a walk through the
grounds. I’ll light a cigar, and sit here by myself, and—And
dream! hey, Walter!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice left him with a kiss, and taking Walter’s arm
they disappeared round an angle of the building, and
walked onward toward their favorite arbor. Every
thing was silent around them; the glowing leaves
hanging motionless upon the trees, and the many-colored
flowers, all seemed listening, as if to some
revelation of the night. The fish-pond was one entire
sheet of silver; not a ripple disturbed its peaceful surface;
and the soft moonlight streamed through the
chinks of the vines and gothic trees, and checkered the
pathway and the floor of the arbor, as the sunbeams
shining through stained cathedral windows rest on the
pavement. The arbor was their chancel, and there
the two lovers stood side by side as if before an altar;
and there Walter told Alice how deeply, how truly he
loved her; how often he had sat alone since they had
known each other, and yet not been lonely, for her
image had always been present to comfort and to
counsel him; how he had longed for the time to come
when he could make this confession to her, when he
could press her to his bosom as the dearly beloved
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice did not speak. She was always silent when
she felt most deeply; but her silence was singularly
eloquent. She did not attempt to withdraw the little
hand which he held so tightly. She did not try to remove
the arm that encircled her waist. Her head lay
upon his bosom, and she wept for very joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now what had become of Old John’s brotherly
scheme? The rainbow hues were now completely
blended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after the two lovers had turned toward the
house, Old John came stealing cautiously through a
neighboring path, where he had been an accidental,
though perhaps not an unwilling listener.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” he exclaimed in a half whisper, rubbing
his hands and smiling most merrily. “I shall hate
him, I am sure,” he added, mimicking Alice. “Good!”
And again he rubbed his hands and smiled with infinite
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The summer had passed away, and autumn was
spreading its rich mantle of yellow leaves over the
trees and shrubs of the old country-seat. The birds
were collecting together in troops, for their journey to
warmer lands, and their songs above the arbor were
sadder than when we last listened to them. The
golden fruit hung temptingly upon the trees, and on the
smooth surface of the fish-pond floated many a withered
leaf. The year was growing old, and its rich covering
of foliage was becoming gray and falling off, yet in
the hearts of Walter and Alice love was as green and
as warm as on the bright summer evening when they
made their mutual confessions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had not yet made Old John their <a id='conf'></a>confidant;
they were waiting for a convenient season. And he,
though he must have known something of their intercourse,
never asked any questions, or seemed at all
curious about the matter, but conducted himself in his
usual quiet way. Indeed, he did occasionally speak
of their close communion, but always in a merry, jesting
way, and no one could suspect him of knowing
how affairs really stood with them. At least his
knowledge did not make him unhappy, for the merry
twinkle was still in his eye, and the smiles still played
round his mouth. In the little walks and excursions
which they took together, Alice was always assigned
to the clerk. Old John said he preferred to walk alone;
then he could swing his cane in any direction without
being scolded, and could climb over a fence, instead of
going half a mile to find a place to crawl through, or a
stile, for the convenience of a lady companion. Walter,
as may be supposed, was very willing to free him
from this incumbrance, and did not mind the half mile
walks in search of a stile, as long as Alice was hanging
on his arm. They had a great many things to talk
about, which was of no consequence to any but themselves,
and were glad of the opportunity to remove
out of earshot, which this stile hunting afforded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning the clerk appeared equipped for traveling.
Business of some kind or other called him, for a
short time, to another part of the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and Alice were alone in the breakfast-room.
He explained to her the necessity of his departure, and
consoled her with the assurance that his absence would
not continue more than a week at the most. He had
just time to place a plain ring on her finger, and steal
one tender, silent kiss from her rosy lips, when Old
John entered, announcing the coach at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few minutes he was seated in the vehicle.
Good-byes were repealed, and soon he was rolling
away on the dusty road toward the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice stood at the window and watched until the
top of the coach had disappeared behind an angle of
the road, and the last sound of the rumbling wheels
had died away. Then the thought and feelings that
had followed him as far as the senses could guide
them, seemed to fall back upon herself, and she felt
oppressed by the silence and utter solitude that reigned
around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was a weary day to Alice. This was her first
love, and their first separation. Her father was busy
with his affairs and could not attend to her; so she
was thrown entirely upon her own resources, and
heavily the hours dragged along in mournful procession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Often days had passed and she had not seen Walter
but for a few moments, yet then she knew he was
near. And now she sat down and tried to fancy him
sitting quietly at his desk; but it wouldn’t do—she
knew better. She walked down by the counting-room
and gathered the flowers as she had often done before,
but they had lost their fragrance, and their colors
seemed faded. The gold-fish stood still in the pond,
and she mistook them at times for the leaves that lay
in the water; they too had faded. She sat in the pleasant
arbor, and looked westward over the beautiful
landscape, but a veil seemed drawn before it, and the
rich and variegated hues which, dolphin-like, the forest
had assumed while dying, to her eyes, seemed blended
into a dead, cold brown. So true it is that the sense
takes its tone from the soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the day passed and the belated evening came
slowly on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do, pray, Ally, put off that sad face,” said Old
John to her, as they sat at the tea-table. “Why you
look ten times more woful than the Italian beggars fresh
from an <a id='erupt'></a>eruption of Vesuvius. Do try to smile a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did try to look cheerful, but at first it tasked all
her powers, yet her father’s raillery and merry laugh
were not to be resisted, and in a little while the cloud
seemed to have passed entirely away, and she was as
cheerful as ever. Sometimes she would fall back into
the silent, thoughtful mood, yet it was only for a moment,
and the evening passed pleasantly. Then came
the affectionate kiss, and the kind good-night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Alice it was a good-night, indeed. Good angels
watched by her pillow, and her dreams were beautiful.
One time she was walking along the garden paths, and
heard the birds singing sweetly above her head, and
saw the flowers in their most beautiful dress. She
drew near the pond, and it was all alive with gold
fish; and the whole surface seemed drawn with red
lines; sometimes they formed charming pictures—trees,
gardens and villages seemed to pass over the
water like a moving diorama. All the people she had
ever seen seemed to be moving about there, some
doing one thing, and some another, but all happy. As
she looked attentively, the surface seemed to grow
mysteriously calm, and the red lines to disappear.
Then as mysteriously it began to grow troubled, circular
waves forming at the centre, and rolling toward
the shore in every direction. Then suddenly from the
middle of the pond, a most beautiful fairy figure arose
and beckoned her near. The fairy gave her a plain,
gold ring, and told her never to part with it; for she
said it was the gift of happiness, and while she wore
that upon her finger, heavy misfortunes should never
visit her. Then a loud voice under water seemed to
call the fairy a “little minx,” and bid her come down
immediately, for breakfast was waiting. Then she
disappeared, the water became calm, and Alice awoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that a dream?” she asked herself, in amazement.
There was the ring on her finger—the fairy’s
gift of happiness; and the voice was still calling some
one to breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a long time before she could collect her scattered
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
senses enough to realize that she had just waked
from a strange dream, and the voice was that of her
father calling her. When the truth did dawn upon her,
she laughed immoderately, and could not help saying
repeatedly, that “it was <span class='it'>very</span> funny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was much past her usual hour of rising, when in
her simple morning-dress she appeared at the breakfast-table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Ally, dear, I thought you never would come
down,” said her father. “I have been waiting this—I
don’t know how long, and called you—I don’t know
how many times. The omelet and coffee are both
as cold as Greenland, I’ll be bound.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t so very late, papa, is it?” inquired Alice;
“besides, I have had such a funny dream—O, it was
perfectly delightful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, never mind, dear, pour out the coffee before
it gets later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She poured out the coffee, still thinking of her strange
dream. It was so funny that she could not help thinking
of it; but her lips would never have wreathed that
happy smile if she could have known the trial that
awaited her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ally, do you know what day to-morrow will be?”
he asked, while his face wore a very doubtful, half
merry, half serious expression. It was something like
the sun trying to break through a fog, for he tried to
look cheerful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice paused a moment as if in thought, then suddenly
exclaimed, “I declare, it is my birthday, and I
had almost forgotten it. It was very good of my dear
papa to remind me of such good news, after I had kept
him waiting so long for his breakfast,” she added,
playfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But do you know who I expect to-morrow?” he
continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was her turn now to look doubtful and perplexed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Ally,” he said, “this afternoon Harry Wilson
and my old schoolmate, his father, will be here. You
must save all your good looks for Harry, for I expect
you will fall in love with him at first sight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was really with much pain that Old John made
this announcement, though he spoke it in as cheerful
a manner as possible, for he knew the effect it would
have on his daughter. He seemed to make it more
from a sense of duty than pleasure, as it were something
which must be told sooner or later; and more
clouds gathered about his honest face than had been
seen there since the death of his wife, when he saw
the effect it had upon Alice. The cheerful smiles
vanished from her face; the color came and went, and
came and went, and at length left her deadly pale.
Her hand trembled and her voice quivered, as she attempted
in vain to make some cheerful remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At least you will try to like him, for my sake,
wont you, Ally, dear?” said her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She uttered a faint “yes”—so faint that it might have
been “no,” for all Old John heard; and pleading some
excuse, left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bad business, this,” said her father, after he was
left alone, and talking as if to some invisible friend.
“Bad business!” and whistling a doleful strain of a
doleful tune, he also left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Alice, poor Alice, she felt lonely enough as she
sat alone in her little room. Thoughts of the dream
that had made her so cheerful but a short time before,
now pressed like an incubus upon her breast. She
knew how much her father was attached to his old
schoolmate, Mr. Wilson, and how much he desired
the union of their two families. It had long been
talked of, but always as something which was about
to happen at some distant, indefinite time; and though
many years had passed since they first began to talk
of it, it still seemed as indefinite and far from accomplishment
as ever; and she never thought to trouble
herself about it; but now the event seemed to spring
up like a phantom directly before her; and so sudden
had been the announcement that she knew not what
to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the hours seemed to glide by as if they
were double-winged. The old entry clock seemed to
her as she sat in her silent chamber, to tick faster and
faster until at last it broke into an actual gallop. If <span class='it'>he</span>
were only here, she thought, as her eye fell upon the
ring which the clerk had placed on her finger. And
more than once she determined to go down to her
father and confess all; then she thought of the old
schoolmate that had saved his life, and her courage
failed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She started as the clock told eleven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was past noon, and Old John was waiting anxiously
for her appearance in the drawing-room; and
his heart beat with strange emotions as he heard her
light footfall on the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was very pale when she entered the room, and
the traces of recent tears were in her eyes. Yet she
had never looked more beautiful, never more lovely.
She was dressed in simple white, and a single white
rose was braided in her dark hair. Old John could not
see her thus dejected without being moved, and the
dark cloud spread over his countenance. She saw it, and
assuming a cheerfulness which she did not feel, drew
her arm around his neck, and kissed him <a id='affect'></a>affectionately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, Ally, dear,” he said, “don’t be cast down.
It will all come right in the end. I say it shall. Do
sit down to the piano and sing a cheerful song. Yes,
sing the one that Walter liked so well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was like asking the Israelites to sing songs of their
home, while captives in Babylon; yet she did sing,
though her voice trembled so much that it was with
difficulty she finished the song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t take it so much to heart, dear,” said Old
John. “I say, if you don’t like him, he shan’t have
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were interrupted by the sound of wheels rolling
up the avenue. How her little heart beat and
fluttered then. A carriage stopped before the door.
Old John’s eye glistened with delight, as if relief had
come at length. A step was heard in the passage.
The door opened, and there stood—Walter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice started to her feet, and stood gazing vacantly
at him, uncertain what to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wont you speak to Harry Wilson?” shouted Old
John, at the top of his voice, and giving a hysterical
kind of laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the truth flashed upon her. With a cry of joy
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
she rushed into his arms, and nestling her head in his
bosom, wept like a child—but they were tears of joy.
Her overstrained feelings found a happy relief. The
dark cloud of sorrow passed away and the sun shone
in all its glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old John capered round the room like a madman,
and declared he had never seen any thing half so pleasant
in all his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it was very cruel of you, dear papa,” said
Alice, kissing him tenderly, after the first effusions of
joy were over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it was, Ally, dear,” exclaimed Old John,
willing to be blamed for any thing now. “I know it
was. But you are such a willful little thing that I was
afraid you wouldn’t like him, and I had set my heart
upon it. I have been tempted more than twenty times
to confess the whole and ask your forgiveness, when I
saw you look so miserable. Yes, Ally, I came very
near spoiling the whole this morning at breakfast. But
never mind, it’s all right now; confess, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, indeed, it was all right! And Alice, in her silent,
eloquent way, soon convinced him that she thought so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the door opened, and Harry Wilson senior entered.
He knew the whole affair, and had only waited
on the outside until the first scene should be over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cordial was the greeting between the old schoolmates.
Smiles, congratulations, and merry words
passed freely; every eye glistened with joy, and all
went merry as a marriage bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I enter that note at five or six per cents.?”
asked some one at the side-door. There stood David
Deans, with a pen behind his ear and another in his
hand—his usual way of ornamenting himself—and
looking as blank and cool as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t enter it with any per cent., you old miser!”
said Old John, patting him familiarly on the back.
“We don’t charge interest this year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>David walked off with a broad grin operating powerfully
upon his countenance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He understood the trick, did David.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a sweet dream under each pillow that
night; and the birth-day on which Alice thought to be
miserable, was the happiest of her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless me, Brother Bill!” exclaimed Uncle Tom,
“if you aint smoking nothing but dust and ashes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I declare, I believe you are right,” answered my
father, somewhat confused, and making a careful examination
of his pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-nights!” were passed, and we all went to
bed with happy hearts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great men were they of olden time; men with far-reaching
and strong, grasping minds—men, too, of discrimination
in what they gathered—“teach them selection,
not collection,” was the word—and they prepared for us
of this distant age monuments to excite admiration and
insure awe; monuments which, while they exhibit what
man is capable of doing, seem, by the perfection of their
form and the adaptation of their parts, to check all spirit
of imitation; monuments which denote all variety of
mental exercise and all the adaptation of physical powers.
It is not alone the chisel of Phidias working out the marble
in a thousand forms, more beautiful than the human
pattern—it is not alone the pencil of Zeuxis that fixed on
canvas the flitting beauties of the field and grove—it is not
alone the vast machinery that piled stone upon stone to
finish the pyramids. Mind speaking to mind has uttered
its powers, and has claimed of the present, wonder for the
past; History and Poetry have embalmed the actions of
the great, or expressed the devotion of the good, and
assured us of the lofty resolves and great deeds of men of
other years. The beauty of the ancient mind, however,
is to be detected by the uses and adaptation of ordinary
incidents—bending them to moral instruction by making
them illustrative of some principle—patriotism, religion,
social duty and domestic relations, or some deeply hidden
power, which sudden emotion, strong impulse, or unexpected
dilemma, is to call into action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Take the following, which is some where extant. We
give only the statement of the asserted fact. We have
no copy of the narrative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leucippe was gathering the small delicate flowers which
blossomed over the dampness of a rock that beetled far
into the sea, and held its cold brow high above the waves
breaking eternally at its base. It was a lovely spot, cool,
fragrant, health-giving, and she took with her her little
child, the only blessing which had been spared. For one
moment the love of the beautiful of nature, the interest
of collecting, triumphed over maternal vigilance. She
turned, however, from the little harvest of sweets, and
saw her boy bending over the edge of the rock, regardless
of all danger, hopeful of only a single beautiful flower
that blossomed on the very edge of the steep. One word
of fear from the mother, one sudden movement toward
the child would have disturbed his balance, and he must
have toppled down beyond all hope of recovery even of
the lifeless form. No time was left for calculation, no
good could result from active efforts. With unspeakable
anguish the mother saw the danger, with the promptness
of woman’s judgment she rejected the ordinary means of
safety; with the instincts of a mother’s heart she threw
herself gently forward, and bared her bosom to the child,
and lured him gently back to nestle on his own home of
comfort, and draw life from the sympathetic founts that
gushed to his honeyed lips. It was the triumph of nature,
and the story seems to have inspired the artist for this
month. A beautiful illustration, while the picture itself
has suggested a title happily expressive of the idea conveyed
in the anecdote, “Nature’s Triumph.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But such a story, so full of instruction, so pregnant
with moral hints, should not be allowed to pass without
an improvement, that may make it more and more beneficial.
The experiment and the result may be properly
styled the triumph of nature, for the deep solicitude of
the mother, and especially her prompt expedient, are as
much the movement of nature as is the affection in
which they originated; and the attraction of the exposed
bosom for the exposed child, was as much the gift
of nature as was the hidden food which that bosom secreted
and stored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we love to consider the success of Leucippe as the
“Triumph of <span class='it'>Affection</span>,” not less than the “Triumph of
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
Nature.” It is <span class='it'>both</span>, as it is differently considered; it is
either, in many ways regarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would the child, amused as it was with the flowers
that jutted out from the rock’s impending edge, and
pleased with the species of independence which its movements
and new position signified, would the child have
been lured by the exhibition of any other bosom than that
of its mother? Had a stranger discovered the little adventurer,
and being like Leucippe, conscious of the danger
of calling aloud, of startling the child by any approach,
had she bared her bosom, would not the infant have turned
away without interest from the exhibition, and pursued
its new occupation of flower gathering? Undoubtedly
the unknown, who had from <span class='it'>prudence</span> done what <span class='it'>affection</span>
suggested to Leucippe, would have seen at once that she
lacked the attractive power, that there was no sympathy
between her and the child. She might have felt all that a
woman can feel for the lovely infant of another—thus dangerously
situated—but the infant itself would not have
been influenced by a corresponding sympathy; it would
have lacked that affection necessary to a proper response
to the exhibition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The triumph, then, is one of affection sympathizing with
affection; corresponding love answering with miraculous
organ, and instructing the great and good of all subsequent
times by the promptings of a mother’s instincts, and the
sympathies of an infant’s feelings. “Out of the mouths
of babes and sucklings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was struck a few months since with the distress that
was bearing down an intimate friend, and he made me the
<a id='dant'></a>confidant of his sorrows, and of their cause. The young
offender had forgotten the respect due to his parents; he
had forgotten or disregarded the <span class='it'>respect</span> which he owed to
the beautiful fame which had come down to him unsullied
through several generations; family pride, instead of exhibiting
itself in supporting the long-descended credit, was
visible in a sort of obstinate adherence to some misconceived
ideas of <span class='it'>self</span>-importance; he was ruining his own
health, and was fast approaching the precipice over which
his passions, or rather let me say, his <span class='it'>passion</span>, would soon
hurry him. His father had, at times, severely chid the
wayward youth, and the mother had, day by day, warned
him of his danger, so that he had by his false estimate of
filial duties and parental care, rather been accelerated in
his progress toward the line of destruction. A change
was suggested in the mode of dealing—his own danger
was not pointed out, but his attention was attracted back
upon those whom he had loved—and had left; he saw
whence he had derived all that delight to childhood, and
he turned back to the fountain of affection which had
gushed anew; and the birds of prey that had been hovering
round the precipice where he hung were disappointed of
their quarry. Those, who had wheeled around him with
pliant wing and open beak, hopeful of spoil, screamed
their disappointment in their filthy eyrie, and confessed
their defeat in the triumph of nature and affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I know well that the voice of kindness, uttered to the
erring, is often disregarded or despised, but less owing to
the want of power in the instrument, than in the want of
preparation in the object. So much of anger is manifested
toward the vicious, that they grow suspicious of every
exhibition of feeling in their behalf. You who would lure
them back to virtue, must not pause at a single token of
kind feeling; repeat the words of consolation; remember
that the very fault which you would correct may have
brought a part of the obstinacy which you deplore—remove
the obstinacy by kindness, and thus open a channel
to the source of the fault. He who would reclaim the
vicious must lay his account to find the moral system
reached in almost all its parts by those faults which by their
prominency seem to be the only ones that appeal for
remedy; and the failure of one measure must invite to another;
if one experiment lacks effect, strengthen it by
another; do not work with single means—it is false
economy. Leucippe bared both breasts to her wandering
infant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Conjugal affection disturbed by some <a id='occ'></a>occurrences which
are unbecoming, and yet seem unavoidable, is not to be
lessened by argument to prove either party right or wrong.
These will, much more readily, create acerbity by wounding
pride, than restore the lapsed passion. Affection has
little to do with the logic of an argument—little to derive
from the temper of discussion. When the evil is evident;
when the disturbance is most oppressive, let not the parties
imagine that any thing like cool reflection is to be had, or
is to be made available; let the woman look back beyond
the season of disquietude; let her bare her affections as
they were when all was sunshine in the domestic circle;
let her appeal to the undisturbed peace of such a scene, and
by her conduct show her erring husband that it is possible
to make the recollection of early delight stronger than the
memory of present bitterness. Men learn this lesson
easily, and practice it willingly. They need a teacher—they
need precept and example; but they are willing to
follow the leadings, and exhibit and rejoice in the triumph
of affection. It is so, apparently in the great things of
religion. Awful as are the dangers of neglect, it would seem
that the terrors of the law are less operative than the persuasions
of love. Notwithstanding the momentous question
propounded, and the alternative made manifest, it
would seem to an ordinary thinker, that the best mode of
preventing a course that would incur the terrible penalty,
would be to present the consequences of neglect, and to
drive by terrible denunciations the erring one from the
path that leads down to death. But not so argues the
inspired Apostle. “Knowing therefore the terrors of the
law,” (how <a id='appall'></a>appalling that thought,) “we <span class='it'>persuade</span> men,”
(how gentle, how enticing, how successful in such a cause
becomes “the triumph of affection.”)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whenever a triumph is to be achieved over evil passions
or vicious habits, then the appeal to the affections by the
affections must be the means employed. We may check
action or delay execution by fear, but we produce no
change in the sentiment, no correction of the motive.
We may prevent the offending one from injuring others,
but we do not by such means lessen his power or his
chance of injuring himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, how much of destruction, how much of the waste of
human feelings, human pride, and glorious self-respect
are due to the want of care in attempts to draw offenders
from the place of moral danger. Go to the home of
wretchedness and vice, and see how promptly the heart
responds to the voice of kindness, how one touch of nature
awakens the memory of early love, and recalls the hour of
peace and virtue, until the heart aches to contemplate the
chasm that vice has placed between the future and the
terrible present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sneer at her who, unable yet to appreciate the consequences
of error, treads the path of danger or dallies on the
borders to gather flowers that blossom near destruction.
Sneer at her and she falls; call her back by the remembrance
of home and home joys, by the love of father and
friend; recall to her mind the unfailing affection of a
mother, and she will turn willingly from her false position,
be saved the crime, and only know what the consequences
might have been, by marking the fate of those who had
none to lure them back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our picture it is believed will be suggestive beyond our
remarks. It deserves a careful examination; may we not
hope that hundreds who gaze at the work of art will take
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
up the moral lesson which it conveys, and resolve that
vice shall owe no triumph to their unkindness, and that
virtue shall not lose its followers for a want of the evidences
of affection in their lives and conduct. It is lessons
such as these that make art useful. It is lessons such
as these that make the pagans respected—it is the “triumph
of nature” over art, and the prevalence of affection over
error, that make Christianity beloved. We are happy to
make this Magazine the vehicle of moral truth, that takes
the best of ancient sentiment and of modern art for its
means, and has for its end the cultivation and triumph of
purest affection.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE RAINY DAY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Odd as it may seem, the condition of the atmosphere has
a powerful influence on the animal spirits. It is the mercury
in the thermometer of mind, indicating its buoyancy
or depression. Who that is an observer of human nature
under its various peculiarities, has not been forcibly struck
with the vast difference in any one intimate friend, both
as to mental activity and sprightliness, on a beautiful,
bright, balmy May morning, and on a cold, cheerless,
comfortless, cloudy, rainy day in the same “moon”? The
whole man is changed—disposition, manner, mind and
temperament have undergone some radical metamorphosis.
The very mode of thought, the sentiments, the opinions
even, are inverted. He who was amiable, instructive,
communicative, and lively, is suddenly, by the veering of
the wind, changed into a sullen, sombre, morose cynic,
restless, moody and taciturn. Conversation is abandoned
for long sighs, deep respiration, involuntary growls and
lugubrious interjections. The agreeable companion of a
clear atmosphere is the thus altered being on <span class='it'>a Rainy Day</span>,
and the influence that has wrought a change so inimical
to individual and domestic economy, is that of the atmosphere.
To account for the cause is more the province of
a scientific pen. Whether electricity be most positive or
negative in certain conditions of the barometer, is a subject
for professors of the various “’isms” and “’icities”
of the day. The effect is too apparent to doubt the existence
of a cause, and the cause too involved in mystery,
to invite discovery by one unlearned in the theories of
Royal “Societies” or Republican “Schools.” “<span class='sc'>The
Atmosphere</span>: <span class='it'>Its Ingredients and Influences</span>,” by John
Smith, Fellow of the Royal Society: London 8vo.
“<span class='sc'>Electricity</span>: <span class='it'>Its Cause, Combinations and Effects</span>,”
by Charles Jones, M. D., Professor of Natural Science in
the Kainbridge University—New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.
“<span class='sc'>Animal Magnetism Investigated</span>,” by Edward
Brown, Member of the United States Philosophical
Society, Late Professor in the Philadelphia Flight School—Philadelphia:
Carey &amp; Hart. “<span class='sc'>The Analogy between
Mind and Matter</span>, <span class='it'>considered in relation to the
Doctrine of Transubstantiation and Revealed Religion</span>,”
by the Right Rev. Bishop Berdott—Universal Christian
Publication Association, Boston: Complete in One Volume—Second
Edition. These, and the like publications,
issuing almost daily, lasting monuments of the power of
the steam-press, are far too repulsive food for the uninitiated
in the art of philosophical digestion. We leave
them to the student, who, with fortitude sufficient for the
effort, will undertake the study of them on <span class='it'>a Rainy Day</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But cause undoubtedly there is, existing somewhere;
for so powerful an agent, revolutionizing our very nature,
must surely have “a local habitation and a name.” Do
not let us suppose that because the various Sir John Rosses
and Sir John Franklins have failed in their researches after
this <span class='it'>primum mobile</span>, that it is hidden from the eyes of
science. One of these seasons we shall be delighted by
an advertisement in all the daily papers announcing thus:
“Wonderful Discovery! Astounding Developments!!
Thousands unable to obtain Admission!!! The Reverend
Neophyte Frisky will deliver a Lecture at the Great Saloon
of the Chinese Museum. Subject—Atmospheric Influence
on Human-Natureology, showing its Cause and
Effects. Experiments will be made after the Lecture.
The Secret will be communicated to classes composed of
Gentlemen and Ladies, at Ten Dollars a ticket. For
notice of the hours of each class see small bills. Admission
(so as to bring it within the reach of all) Five Cents—Children
half price—Unbelievers admitted Free.” Thus
faith in the hidden things of science will be made clear to
the eyes of the million, and the singular phenomenon, exhibiting
itself in its manifest effects from a hitherto undiscovered
cause, will become as familiar to men as the
horrors of <span class='it'>a Rainy Day</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We fear that some will naturally regard these remarks
as intended to cast reproach on scientific investigation, and
research into the wide fields of pathological—naturo-philosophical—moral-philosophical
love. Far from it. We
beg to invite volunteers to unite in an overland expedition
after the philosopher’s stone. Let a company be formed
on shares, armed and equipped with revolvers and rifles
of the latest theory, to shoot opposition on the way for
food for the Association—with India Rubber life-boats to
cross the streams, and Gutta Percha tents to repose in on
the march—secure a flying-machine on the last model, to
transport the enthusiasts over mountains, and stock enough
at $5 a share to start the <span class='it'>enterprise</span>, if not the <span class='it'>expedition</span>.
We would not only invite the formation of such Associations
in all the Atlantic cities, but suggest to rural scientificators
to leave the plough of successful homebred labor,
sell out their little all, and invest at once. Why drudge
longer, alone and single-handed, when these combinations
and associations insure the journey to be made in six
weeks from the “Independence” of the first start. But,
reader, let us advise you, if you are seriously impressed
with the propriety of the undertaking and its certain success,
don’t dwell on the results to be attained on <span class='it'>a Rainy
Day</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suggestions of unbelief in any novelty are more common
than should be. A course of opposition to the march
of mind, camping in its progress at startling or astounding
discoveries, is detrimental to the developments of
science, applied to every day use. We do not desire to
be regarded as cynical or infidel, and therefore avow an
attachment to these novelties <span class='it'>ex limine</span>. The utter incomprehensibility
of any scheme is no objection to its
feasibility. Far from it. On the contrary, the less it is
understood the more it is applauded. Once announced for
the investigation of the masses, a public meeting is called,
as follows: “TOWN MEETING. The citizens of the
village of Love-Your-Enemies will assemble in the Hall
where ‘justice is judicially administered,’ on Saturday
evening next, at 6 o’clock, to consider the propriety of
memorializing Congress to grant 100,000 acres of the
public domain, for the purpose of raising a fund to be invested
in the capital stock of a company about to be
formed, to construct an Electro-Magnetic Wire Suspension
Bridge from the Narrows, at New York, to Tusca
Light-House, on the English coast. Mr. Amasa Foresight
Marblehead, the discoverer of this wonderful invention
for the benefit of mankind, and patent pacification of nations,
will be present and explain its principal features.”
Signed by Hon. Col. Maj. M.D. Rev. Esq. The meeting
convenes at the appointed time. Speeches are made.
Diagrams, models, drawings, lithographs, sections are exhibited.
The audience are delighted, mystified, gratified,
magnified, humbuggified, and somnambulified. Resolutions
are offered. A disciple of Roger Sherman objects,
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
and sonorously desires the <span class='it'>Cui Bono</span> in facts and figures.
Question! Question! is shouted by the Esquire who
signed the call, the brother of the chairman, and the gentleman
who organized the meeting. These vocular demonstrations
become public opinion, and under its
supreme potent influence the resolutions are adopted, and
the assembly adjourns. All is wonder, amazement and
vacuity. One doubts. He is beleaguered by the President,
Vice-President and Secretaries of the meeting, and silenced
with “specific gravity,” “conic sections,” “capillary
attraction,” “latent pressure,” “<a id='mall'></a>malleability of metals,”
“attraction of cohesion,” “sinuosity of fluxions,” and
the superior capacity of the arch over the horizontal, to
bear weight. The object is accomplished—the probability
assumes the shape of certainty—the unsophisticated are
converted—the community is alive to the absolute necessity
of the project—the most flattering prospects are in
the future. The bridge is built on paper, and on this mid-air
viaduct is represented flour and corn pouring into
England, and emigrants and their progeny pouring out.
How delightful! Well, “probably the humbug of the
thing” would never have been made known, had it not
been for the morbid disposition of some skeptic, exaggerated
by the atmospheric influence of <span class='it'>a Rainy Day</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The atmospheric influence, then, is savagely detrimental
to the mature development of extraordinary discoveries.
In this it is auti-practico-scientific, and will, ere long, be
driven from scholastic favoritism. Unwelcome as we have
shown it to be in individual and scientific economy, we
trust our researches into the economy of politics will
prove more favorable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The State is a comprehensive word, meaning a conglomeration
of voters. Voters are men presumed to be
aged one-and-twenty each—that is, every voter must be,
by law, in a majority before an election at which he votes,
but it is not unlawful for him to be in a minority after he
has voted. At this maturity they are infected with the
frailties of humanity, consequently they agree and disagree
with each other. Thus parties are formed on the
basis of “principles, not men,” for the one, and “men,
not principles,” for the other. On the supremacy of one
of these combinations the safety of the State depends—so
each conscientiously believes. To test the question, elections
have been established—a modern republican invention,
instead of the old “wager of battle.” The note of
preparation is sounded. Martial music echoes in city,
village, town and valley, in token of the peaceful nature
of the coming contest. The voters of each party are
gathered under banners inscribed with the poetry of
politics Speeches are made by the humble aspirant after
public fame in the shape of “spoils,” a figurative designation
for the reward of patriotism. The taverns are filled;
disquisitions on political principles, qualifications for
public servants, the past history of nominees, and the future
prospects of the faithful, are discussed with the blandness
and courtesy which mark all polemic controversies.
In order to purify the political atmosphere of such assemblies
in those party craniums called “Head Quarters,”
the fumes of tobacco, flavored with the insensible distillations
of “old rye” or “Monongahela,” are used <span class='it'>ad
libitum</span>. This, by the aid of music, speeches, rum and
tobacco, “the great principles of the party” are preserved
from decay, and made palatable to “generations yet unborn.”
As the contest progresses, it is more and more
marked by enthusiasm, sincerity, patriotism, self-devotedness
to those abstractions born in “’98,” and destined to
a green old age, or their immemorial antagonistic dogmas
of a more northern extraction. Music, meetings, speeches
and speculations, banners and bantering, polemics and
pyrotechnics, rum and rows, fights and fabrications,
placards and publications, advocates and anathemas, multiply
in <a id='prop'></a>proportion to the chances of success. Committees
of vigilance are active—window-committees impatient—voters
are volatile and vicarious—candidates are cajoling,
cabaling, convivial, cautious, curious and concerned. Thus
progresses the campaign. The day arrives—Election
Day—big with the fate of patronage and place. “To the
Polls, Freemen, to the Polls!” is conspicuous at every
turn, reminding those who have just awoke to the objects
of the day, after weeks spent in fruitless attempts to convince
them of the importance of the “Second Tuesday”
in the political Almanac. Voting is this absorbing business.
“Vote early,” is announced as of the utmost consequence.
“Vote for John Smith,” is pronounced the
only miracle by which liberty can be guaranteed to the
nation. Workingmen are informed that John Brown is
alone advised of the most salutary remedy for all their
evils. Business men are warned that prosperity will
abound under a Tariff, with the cabalistic addition of
“’42,” and that ruin belongs to that of “’46.” The timid
are startled by the announcement that the “country is
ruined,” and the “constitution has been violated,” while
anon is proclaimed that “the dearest rights of freemen are
in jeopardy.” So passes the “Second Tuesday”—voting,
voting, voting, “on age,” “on papers,” “on tax receipts,”
and “on principle.” There must be an end to
all things. So with Election Day. The polls are closed.
The counting begins. Majorities and victories are cheered
as published. One party claims success from figures, the
other from numbers. One calculates success, the other
votes it. It is decided, at last, by the indisputable returns.
The victors attribute their triumph to the people; the defeated
find consolation in the fact that they would have
been triumphant, had it not been—<span class='it'>a Rainy Day</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atmospheric influences are suicidal, it seems, in politics.
And as it may seem, the character of the atmosphere has
a powerful influence on other things beside animal spirits.
Reader, pause—our task is done. Of a highly mercurial
temperament, affected with despondency or hilarity, as
the sky is cloudy or clear, we were forced to get rid of ourself
on one of those pluvious phenomena in the temperate
zone, and hence we wasted our own time and yours by
dedicating our reflections to <span class='it'>The Rainy Day</span>.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>H. Kavanagh. A Tale. By H. W. Longfellow. Boston:
Wm. D. Ticknor &amp; Co. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This volume has been very extensively read, has delighted
almost every reader, and yet has left on the minds
of many a feeling of disappointment. Considered as a
novel, it must be admitted that the story is but slight, the
characters hinted rather than developed, and the whole
frame-work fragile; but it would perhaps be more fair to
judge it according to the purpose the author had in view
in writing it, and this purpose was evidently not the production
of a consistent novel, but the illustration of an
idea through the forms of a tale. Mr. Churchill, who is
always meditating a romance and never producing one,
and while musing over the idea is unconscious of the
romance developing under his very eyes, is a good illustration
of the motto of the work⁠—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“The flighty purpose never is o’ertook,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Unless the deed go with it.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The romance present to Mr. Churchill’s vision, but which
he does not perceive, is, to be sure, a common one, but
none the less affecting because it is common. It is a
simple but quietly intense representation of love in its two
great expressions in life—the love which imparadises and
the love which breaks hearts; and it has no reference at
all to time, but is the universal fact of all ages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to his lovers, Mr. Longfellow has sketched
with much beautiful humor, the characters and characteristics
of a country town. His mirth is the very poetry of
mirth, sly, genial, fanciful, reminding the reader of Dickens
without suggesting the thought of imitation. All the incidents
and emotions of the book are enveloped in an
atmosphere of poetry. It is this magical charm of the poet,
investing the commonest materials with a drapery of imagination,
and sending a rich and golden flush through the
whole expression, which constitutes the merit of the
volume. An ideal sweetness, sometimes felt in the music
of the words, sometimes in the fine felicity of the imagery,
and sometimes in the “soft, Ausonion air,” breathed
upon the characters, pervades equally the author’s humor,
pathos, sentiment, passion and reflection. The effect of
the whole is not to thrill or exalt the reader, not to inspire
terror or awaken thoughts “beyond the reaches of
his soul,” but to fill him with the highest possible degree
of intellectual and moral comfort. There are no stings in
the author’s mind, and he plants none in the minds of
others. He is a mortal enemy to unrest, to all haggard
and unhandsome thoughts and sensibilities, and fuses
matter and spirit into a sensuous compound, calculated
to give poetic pleasure rather than to inspire poetic action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is one fault to the book more serious, perhaps, than
any other, and that is its shortness. The characters are
well conceived, but imperfectly developed. The premises
of Kavanagh’s character are excellent, but no conclusion
is drawn from them except his marriage, and that is something
of a <span class='it'>non-sequitur</span>. The ground is fairly broken for a
long work, for a sort of American Wilhelm Meister, and
though the author’s plan hardly demands its cultivation to
the extent of its capacity, we feel rather provoked that he
did not make his plan commensurate with the elements of
his characters. In Kavanagh we have a reformer who
blends cultivated and sensitive tastes with great aspirations,
and to have fully developed such a person, by representing
the modifications of his mind through its contact
with the reformers and conservatives of New England,
would have enabled Mr. Longfellow to produce the
most original and striking novel of the day, and one which
would have been a mirror of New England life in its present
manifestations. The ideas and purposes of Kavanagh
alone are given, and he, rather than Mr. Churchill spreads
a gulf between intentions and deeds. To have made the
woman he loved non-sympathetic with him as a reformer,
and the woman he did not love his adherent in that capacity,
would have finely complicated the matter, and resulted
in many original agonies, ecstasies, mental struggles,
and thrilling situations. Such a novel, even if, like
Goethe’s, it had cost ten years’ labor, would, as treated
by Mr. Longfellow, have obtained an instantaneous and
enduring popularity.</p>

<hr class='tbk144'/>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>My Uncle the Curate. A Novel. By the Author of “The
Bachelor of the Albany” etc. New York: Harper &amp;
Brothers.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The mere announcement of any thing from the sparkling
brain of the Bachelor of the Albany, is sufficient to raise
anticipations of brisk and business-like satire, of felicitous
expression, and of good-natured representation of the follies
of conventional life. The present work evinces more of
the novelist, and less of the wit-snapper, than any thing
the author has previously written. The story and the
characters, though plentifully bespangled with epigrams,
are still not immersed and lost in them; and there is not
that incessant effort after smartness and point which at
one period seemed to be the law of the writer’s mind. Mr.
Woodward, the Curate, has some capital traits of character
felicitously developed, and his wife, belonging to
that kind of women known as everybody’s mother, is
drawn to the life. In Mrs. Spenser we have one of those
plagues of mankind, who cause more misery than pestilence
and war—a nervous, fretful, peevish, unsatisfied,
vinegar-souled wife, engaged in slaughtering her husband
with pins, and making up for the weakness of her instruments
by the continuity of her attacks. Lucy McCracken
appears to have been suggested by Thackeray’s Becky
Sharp, and she is in every way inferior to the latter in the
logic of her artfulness. Dawson, Sidney Spenser, Markham
and Vivyan, are all well discriminated delineations
of young men, though the lover is the least interesting.
The author is something of a bungler in handling the
passions and affections, and considered as a man of wit, is
singularly blind to the ludicrous effect which his serious
scenes often produce. He is a capital laugher at the sentimentalities
and agonies of other novelists, but when he
ventures into their region he is as far from common sense
and natural feeling as any of the dabblers in broken hearts
and crushed affections whom he ridicules.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Personal History and Experience of David Copperfield
the Younger. By Charles Dickens. Illustrated by
H. K Browne. New York: John Wiley. Part I.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The announcement of a new work by the most popular
novelist of the day, is quite an event to the famished lovers
of his genius. It is difficult to judge from the first number
whether it will be worthy of the author’s fame, but it
promises well both in respect to originality and interest.
With the characteristic traits of Dickens’s style and mode
of delineating characters and narrating events, it starts a
new society of individuals, who may rival the old familiar
names in popularity. The peculiar humor, fancy, sweetness,
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
and verbal felicity, which have already delighted so
many thousands, appear in this work with their old power,
and give no signs of decay. For knowledge of the heart
we would allude to the scene in which Mrs. Copperfield
questions Davy as to the exact words the gentleman at
Lowestoft used in speaking of her beauty, as pre-eminently
excellent. For quaint humor, bordering continually on
pathos, the life which Davy led in the queer house on
Yarmouth beach, with Peggotty’s relations, might be
triumphantly quoted to silence all doubts of Dickens’s
continued fertility. The knowledge evinced throughout
of the interior workings and external expression of a
child’s mind, is quite remarkable. Indeed, if the author
proceeds as he has commenced, there can be little fear of
his success. It remains, however, to be seen, whether or
not his characters will please through twenty numbers.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Holydays Abroad; or Europe from the West. By Mrs.
Kirkland. New York: Baker &amp; Scribner. 2 vols. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The accomplished authoress of these elegant volumes
has established so good a reputation by her previous
writings, that we opened her present book with some reluctance,
fearing that the subject would be too threadbare
even for her powers to make interesting. Indeed records
of tours in Europe have become so common, so natural an
employment of aspiring mediocrity, that to read them is
an exercise in yawning, and to criticise them an assumption
of the office of executioner. We prefer dullness in
almost any other form. It is due to Mrs. Kirkland, however,
to acknowledge that she has triumphed over the
disadvantages of her subject, and produced a really interesting
work, avoiding all the wearisome topographical
inanities and stereotyped opinions of most tourists, and
giving a new and vivid glimpse of foreign life. She appears
to understand the wants of her readers, and she tells
them the very things they most desire to know. Her
passage on St. Peter’s is one instance among many which
the book affords, of her knowledge of the ignorance of her
readers, and her felicity in suggesting a view of a whole
subject by fixing on a few important details. She generally
succeeds in conveying so warm an impression of the
objects she describes, as to make her readers the companions
in the journey.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Adirondack; or Life in the Woods. By J. T. Headley,
Author of Washington and his Generals, etc. New York:
Baker &amp; Scribner. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In this volume the dashing and brilliant author of Napoleon
and his Marshals has occupied a new ground. The
northern section of the state of New York, comprising
nearly eight counties, is still an unsubdued forest, “crossed
by no road, enlivened by no cultivation, not a keel disturbing
its waters, while bears, panthers, wolves, moose and
deer, are the only lords of the soil.” Into this region Mr.
Headley conducts his readers, and certainly few subjects
could be better fitted for his picturesque pen. The magnificent
scenery of the region he has described with great
force, freshness and pictorial effect, and the various adventures
incident to a life in the woods, are narrated with the
author’s accustomed vigor and raciness. The work being
in the form of familiar letters, admits of every style of verbal
expression which truly reflects the feeling of the moment,
and the reader is therefore not troubled by the presence of
those occasional audacities of diction which, in Mr. Headley’s
more elaborate works, sometimes offend a pure taste.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Analogy of the Ancient Craft, Masonry, to Revealed Religion.
Gregg &amp; Elliott.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is the title of a beautifully printed octavo volume,
from the pen, and evidently from the heart, of Charles
Scott, A. M., Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of the
State of Mississippi. The literature of the Order of
Masonry is not extensive, for reasons that the members of
the Order probably fully comprehend. It is confined to a
few volumes of addresses, and to some liturgies and handbooks;
all, of course, useful to the craft, but not all interesting
to the world. The volume before us is the result
of much deep feeling, which manifested and employed
itself in careful research, close reading, sustained reflection,
and an able exposition of the results of all those
processes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Analogy is ably made, and though the uninitiated
may not feel the same interest as do the “craftsmen” in
the Analogy, yet many readers will find on its pages much
to admire, much that will instruct, much that will lead
him to reflect and inquire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The initiated who sits down to the book with a love of
the institution, will find that love augmented, his respect
increased, and his views greatly enlarged by the developments
of the able author of the volume. We commend
the work to the attention of general readers, but especially
to those who share membership with Mr. Scott.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Last Leaves of American History: Comprising Histories
of the Mexican War and California. By Emma Willard.
New York: Geo. P. Putnam. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Commencing with the inauguration of General Harrison,
Mrs. Willard presents us with a clear and condensed account
of the events which followed to the close of the
Mexican war. Although most of them are familiar to the
readers of the newspapers, we suppose that few minds
possess them in their order and connection, stripped of all
exaggeration and telegraphic inaccuracies. Mrs. Willard
writes in a bold, decisive style, without any apparent
partisan object, and with no other purpose to serve than
to glorify the country as far as it can be done without any
sacrifice of truth. We have found the volume interesting
and accurate.</p>

<hr class='tbk150'/>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Genius of Italy: being Sketches of Italian Life, Literature
and Religion. By Rev. Robert Turnbull, Author
of Genius of Scotland, etc. New York: Geo. P. Putnam.
1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is an exceedingly interesting and well-written
volume, full at once of discernment and enthusiasm, exhibiting
considerable knowledge of Italian literature,
scenery, manners and character, and showing a true Anglo-Saxon
sagacity in its views of the present state of Italy.
The work is both descriptive and critical, and many passages
have a pictorial distinctness which prove that the
objects described were visibly mirrored on the writer’s
imagination as he wrote. The sketches of Dante, Tasso,
Ariosto, Petrarch, contain many correct opinions, and are
well calculated to convey information as well as to inspire
enthusiasm for the genius of Italy.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>History of King Charles the Second of England. By Jacob
Abbott. With Engravings. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.
1 vol. 16mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a most useful and entertaining biography of a
regal roué, whose reign is the scoff and jeer of history.
Charles was a good-natured rascal, whose destitution of
principle and indifference to shame, approached the marvelous.
The record of his reign is full of matter for reflection,
and Mr. Abbott has presented it with more than
his accustomed felicity in the selection of events, and
graceful simplicity of style.</p>

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
